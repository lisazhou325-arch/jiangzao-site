So are there really three hours of questions or it? Are we fucking serious? Yeah, you don't a lot. You're talking about Elon. Holy point, man. I mean. it's the most interesting point. All the story lines are kind of converging Yeah, right now. So we'll see . how much almost like I planded exactly. Well, that would never do a such a thing. So as you know better than anybody else. the total cost of ownership of a data center, only ten to 15% is energy. And that's a part you're presumably saving by moving this into space. Most of it's the GPU's. If they're in space, it's hard der service them or you can't service them. And so the depreciation cycle goes down on them. So it's just way more expensive to have the GPU's in space, presumably. What's the reason to put them in space? Well, the availability of energy is the issue. So I mean if you look at at electrical output outside of China, but everywhere outside of China it's more or less flat. It's where you know maybe a slight increase, but for pretty much flat, China has a rapid increase in and electrical output. But if you're putting data centers anywhere except China, where are you gonna to get your electricity? Especially as you scale the output of chips is growing pretty much exponentially, but the output electricity is flat. So how you going to tell them what chips are? You know, magical power sources. magical electricity Faries. You're famous, you're your famous big fan of solar. one terawatt of solar power. So with a 25% body factor, like four terawatts of solar panels, it's like 1% of the land area of the United States. And it's like in this, you were in the singularity when you've got one terawatt of data centers, right? So what are we running out or exactly . how far into the singularity are you? You tell me. Yeah, exactly. So so I think we'll find we're in the singularity and like, okay, let's look a long way to go. But he's just like, is the plan to like put it in the space after we've covered Nevada and solar panels? I think it's pretty hard to cover about solar panels. You have to get like permits from like the poets for try . getting the poets for that. So space is really a regular. It's really a regulatory play. It's like harder to build on land than it is in space. It's harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space. But but also the but you're going to get about five times the effectiveness of cell lar pals in space versus to the ground. And you don't need batteries. I almost wore my other shirt, which says it's always Sunny in space, which is so because you don't have a daynight cycle or seasonality clouds or an atmosphere in space, because the atmosphere alone, we're still seeing about a 30% loss of energy. So so you any given solar panels can do it about five times more powering space than on the ground, and you avoid the cost of having batteries to Carry you through the night. So it's actually much cheaper to do in space. And my prediction is that it will be by far the cheapest place to put AI will be space in 36 months or less, maybe 3036 months, less than 36 months. How do you service GPU's as they fail, which happens quite often in training. Actually, it it depends on how recent the GPU's are. That right? I mean, at this point, we find our GPU's to be quite reliable. There's infant mortality, which you can obviously iron out on the ground, so you can just run them on the ground and confirm that you don't have info mortality with the GPU's. But once they start working, their actual reliability, and once they start working, and you'll PaaS the initial you know debug cycle of nvideo, whatever, whoever's making the trips could be Tesla Tesla AI six chips, or something like that, or it could be you know tpus, or traums or whatever the rivalries, actually, they're quite reliable past certain point. So I don't think I don't think the servicing thing is an issue. But you can mark my words. And in 36 months, but probably closer to 30 months, the the the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space. And then and and and and then it will get from ititthen, get like ridiculously better to get in space. And then the the scaling, the only place you can really scale is space. Know once don't you start thinking in terms of what percentage of the sun's power are you harnessing? You realize you have to go to space. You can't scale very, very much on earth, but very much, to be clear. you're talking like teraats. Yeah well, all of the United States currently uses only half a terawatt hour on average. Yeah right. So you know if you say a terawatt, that would be twice as much electricity that United States currently consumes. So that's quite a lot. And can you imagine building that many data centers I that many power plants? It's like those who have like lived in software land don't realize that they're they're about to have a hard lesson in hardware, that it's actually very difficult to build power plants. And then you don't just need a need power plants. You need all of the electrical equipment, need that the electrical transformers to run the transformers, the AI transformers. Now the utility industry is a very slow industry. They are pretty much you the imppeding smash to to the government, the public utility Commission. So they're they Peter smash like literally invigorantly. So they're very slow because the their past has been very slow. So trying to get them to move fast is just like you know like you try to do an interconnect agreement with have you ever tried to do an Internet interconnect agreement with a utility at scale like with a lot of power? As a professional podcaster, I can say that I'm am not. In fact. they have to just leave many more views before that becomes an issue. They have to do a study for a year, okay, like a year later, theycome back to you with their Internet connect study. But can't you tell this with your own behind the meter power stuff? You can build power plants. Yeah that's what we did. Xi for classes two it so for for classes too. But so Yeah. why we're talking about big bridge. Why not just like build GPU's and power colators? So so we did. Right? Right. But I'm saying, why isn't this a generalized solution? You're talking about all the issues. Where do you get the power plus from? I'm saying when you talk about all the issues working with utilities. you can just build private power plants with the with the data centers, right? But it begs the question of where do you get the power plants? Where you where do you get the power plants from? I mean, the power plant makers. why is your saying Yeah like does the gas turbine backlog basically, yes, you can dridown to a level further. It's it's the the veins and blades in the turbines that are the limfactor because the casting, it's like a very specialized process to cast the blades and veins in the turbines using gas power. And it's very difficult to scale other forms of power. You can scale potentially solar, but the tariffs currently importing solar in the us are gigantic. The domestic solar production is is pitiful. Why not make solar? That seems like a good Elon shapes problem. We are going to make solar. Okay, Yeah but both SpaceX and Tesla are botowards 100 gigawatts of solar cell production. How low down . the stlike from Polly silicon up to the wafer to the final panel. I think you got to do the whole . thing from raw materials to finish the cell. Now if it's going to space, it's actually the cost. It costs less than it's easier to make solar cells that go to space because they don't need glass or they don't need much glass and they don't need heavy framing because they don't have to up survive weather events. There's no weather in space. So it's actually a cheaper solar cell that goes to space than the one on the ground. Is there a path to getting them as cheap as you need in the next 36 months? Solar cells were already very cheap. They're like far cheap. And if you say, you know, I think like socells in China are around like 25, $0.30 a watt or something like that, it's absurdly cheap. And when you take into a cat, put now put it in space and it's five times cheaper because it's five times, in fact, it's not five times cheaper. It's ten times cheaper because you don't need any batteries. So so the moment your cost of access to space becomes low, by far the cheapest and most scalable way to to generate tokens is space. It's not even close, but itbe an order of magnitude easier to scale and chips aside of order of magnitude, if the point is you won't be able to scale the ground, just you just won't pulling it hit the wall big time on power generation, there already are. So so like the number of sort of miracles and series that the xai team had to accomplish in order to get a gigawatt power online was crazy. We had to gang together a whole bunch of turbines and then and then we had permit issues in Tennessee and and had to go across the border to Mississippi, which is fortunately only you know, a few miles away. So but then we still had to run the high power lines a few miles and build the power Plin Mississippi. And it was very difficult about that. And people understand, like how much electricity do you actually need at the generator level, at the generation level in order to power a data center? Because they look at the news, we'll look at the power consumption of, say, gb 300 and multiply that by thing and then think best amount amount of power you need while the cooling I wake up. Yeah. Like that's a that's a total and new. You've never done any hardware in your life before besides the gb 300. You've got to power all of the networking hardware. There's a whole bunch of cpu and storage stuff that's happening. You've got a size for your peak cooling requirements. So that means can you cool even on the worst hours of the worst day of the year? Well, it gets pretty freaking hot in Memphis. So so you're going to have like a 40% increase on your power just for cooling, assuming you don't want your data center to turn off on hot days and to keep going. Then then you've got to say, well, there's another multiplicative element on top of that, which is, are you assuming that you never have any hiccups in your power generation? Like well, actually sometimes you have to take the generators, some of the power offline in order to service it. Oh, okay. Now you add another 20, 25% multiplier on that. Because you've got to assume that you've got to take power offline to services. So the actual roughly every 110000 gb 300 s, inclusive of networking, cpu, storage, cooling margin for servicing power is roughly 300 megawatts. Sorry, you said it again. It's it's it's roughly or we're thinking about it like what do you think about like 330000 to to to actually the what you need at the generate generation level? So service probably service 330000 gb 300, including all of the associated support, networking and everything else and and and the peak cooling and have some margin, some power margin reserve is . roughly a gigawatt. Can I ask a very naquestion? Yeah. you know you're describing . the engineering details of doing this stuff on earth, but then there's analogous engineering difficulties of doing it in space. How you do how do you replace them in a band with orbital lasers etc., etc.? How do you make it resistant to radiation? I don't know in the details of the engineering, but fundamentally, what is the reason to think those challenges which have never been had to be addressed before will end up being easier than just like building more turbines on earth? There's companies that build turbines on earth. They can make more turbines, right? I invite good. Tried doing it and then you'll see. So like the turbines are sold out through . 2:30. Have you guys . considered making your own? I think in order for in order to bring enough power online, I think SpaceX and Tesla will probably have to make the turbine blades, the bands and blades internally for just the blades . or the turbines. the limiting factor. You can get everything except the blades. They call the blades and blades. You can get that twelve to 18 months before the veins of blades limiting factor, the veins of blades. And there are only three casting companies in the world that may make these, and they're massively backlogged. Is this Siemens ge. those guys, or is it a subject? Now, it's other companies. I mean, sometimes they have a little bit of casting capability in house, but I'm just saying you can just you can just call any of the turbine makers and they will tell you it's not top secret. It's probably on the Internet right now. If it wasn't for the tariffs, would colossus be solar powered? It would be much easier to make it solar hard. The tariffs are not so several hundred percent. So don't you know some people, Wilson, need speed? Yeah. No. You know president has, you know, we don't agree on everything and this administration is not the biggest fan of solar. So . anyway, we also need the land, the permits, everything. So if we try to move very fast, like I do think scaling solar on earth is a good way to go, but you do need some amount of time to find the laget, the permits, get the solar, pair that with the batteries. Why would it not work to stand up your own solar production? And then you're right that you eventually went out of land, but there's a lot of land here in Texas. There's a lot of land in Nevada, including private land. It's not about publicon Ned Land. And so yoube able to at least get the next colossus and like the next one after that. And at a certain point, you hit a wall. But wouldn't that work for the moment? But as I said, we are scaling solar production. There's a rate at which you can scale physical production of solar, solar cells, where I'm going as fast as possible in scaling domestic production, you're making the solar cells. Add Tesla. Both Tesla and SpaceX have a mandate to get to 100 gigawatts a year of solar. Speaking of the annual capacity, I'm curious, in five years time, let's say, what will the installed capacity be? Honor, earth versus is long. And in space, I deliberately pick five years because it's after your winwe're up and running threshold. And so in five years time, Yeah, let's see. On earth versus . in space installed AI capacity five years. I think probably if you say that five years from now, we're probably AI and space will be launching every year, but the some total of all AI on earth in excess me, five years from now, my prediction is we will launch and be operating every year more AI in space than the than the cumulative total on earth, which is I would expect to be at least sort of five years from now, a few hundred gigawatts per year of AI in space and rising. So you can get to, I think you on earth, you can get to around a terawata year of AI in space before you start having Yeah, you know, fuel supply challenges for the rocket, okay? But you think you can . get to hundreds of gigawatts per year in five years time? Yes. So 100 gigawatts depending on the specific power of the whole system with solar arrays and radiators and everything is is on the order of like 10000 starship launches. Yes. And you want to do that in one year. And so that's like one starship launch every hour. Yeah. That's happening in this city. Like walk me through a world where there's ten, there's a starship launch . every single hour. Yeah. I mean, that's what actually a low rate compared to airlines like like aircraft aircraft. There's a lot of airports, the lower airforce ts good. And you gotta launch this you know, the polar orbit and it doesn't have to be polar, but but you you just, there's there's some some value to some synchronous but but I think actually, you just go high enough, you you start getting out of a shadow, you know so how many . physical starships are needed to do 10000 launches a year? I don't think we'll lead more than I mean, you could you could probably do it with as few as like 20 or 30. Like it really depends on how quickly does the ship the ship has to go around the earth and the ground track before the ship has to come back over the launch pad. So if you can use a ship every, say, 30 hours, you could do it with 30 shifts. But but we'll make more shifts than that. But the SpaceX is going up to do 10000 watches a year, and maybe even 20 or 30000 watches. You know, is the idea to become basically . hyperscalar become an oracle and lend this capacity to other people with what are you going to do with, and presumably SpaceX is the one launching all this, so sphas become a . hyperscalar hyper, hyper. Yeah. I mean, if summany my predictions come, SpaceX will lamore AI than the cumulative amount on earth combined of everything else combined. Is this mostly in French or mostly AI will be able to like already? Inference for the purpose . of training is most trained. And there's a narrative that the the change in discussion around a SpaceX ipo is because previously SpaceX was very capital efficient. Jose wasn't to that expensive to develop that even though it sounds expensive, it's actually very capital efficient in how it runs. Whereas now you're going to need more capital than just can be raised in the private markets. Like if the private markets can accommodate raes of, as we've seen from the AI labs, tens of billions of dollars, but not beyond that. Is it that you'll just need more than tens of billion of dollars per year and that's by Sathe public. Yeah, I'd be careful about saying things about companies that might go public. You know if you make general. you make that's haven't been a problem for you, elan. You know there's a price to pay . for these things. Make some general statements for us about the depths of the capital markets . between public and private markets. Yeah, there's there's lot more capital in the very general. There's obviously a lot more capital available in the public lic markets than private. I mean, it might be it's at least at least it might be 100 times more capital. but at least Yeah, Yeah but way more than ten. But isn't it also the case that things that tend to be very capital intensive, if you look at, say, real estate as you know, a huge industry that raise a lot of money each year at an industry level that tends to be debt financed because by the time you're deploying that much money, you . actually have . a pretty neclear revenue stream exactly and a near term return. And you see this even with the data center build outs, which are famously being you know financed by the the private . credit industry. And so why not just debt finance? Speed is important. So I'm generally going to do the thing that I mean, I just repeatedly tackle limiting factor. Whatever the limiting factor is on speed, I'm going to tackle that. So there's if capital is learning factor, then I'll solve for capital. If it's not limiting factor. I'll solve for something else. Based on your statements about Tesla and being public, I wouldn't have guessed that you thought the fast the way to move fast is to be public. Normally, I would say it. That's that's like I said, I mean, I'd love to talk about some more detail, but the problem is like if you talk about quality companies, whether they become public, you got into trouble . and then you have to delay your offering . and then you and as you said, solve for speed. Yes, exactly. So, so, so you can't hipe companies that are, that may, that might go public. So that's why we have to be a little careful here, but we can't talk about physics. So the way you think about scaling long term is that earth only receives about half a Billith of the sun's energy. And the sun is the sun is essentially all the energy. This is a very important point you appreciate, because sometimes people will talk about marginal nuclear reactors or any you know various fusion on earth, but but you have to step back a second and say, if if you're going to climb the cartoship v scale and have some nontrivial and harness some nontrivial percentage of the the science energy, like Lisa, you wanted to Highness a millionth of the sun's energy, which sounds pretty small. That would be about, call it, roughly 100000 times more electricity than we currently generate on earth for all of civilization. Again, we'll take an order bank to so it obviously, the only way to scale is to go to space with solar from launching from earth, you can get to about a terawatt per year. Beyond that, you want to go, you want to launch from the moon. You want to have a MaaS driver on the moon. And that MaaS driver on the moon you could do probably. A petal want per year . we're talking king, these kinds of numbers, you know, terror watts of compute presumably whether you're talking land or space far, far before this point you've like run into, you know, you actually need, maybe you don't the solar panels are more efficient, but you still need the chips. You still need the logic and the memory and so forth. And you need to build a . lot more chips and make them much cheaper, right? And so how are we getting a tarot out of like right now the world doesn't gonna be 2025 gigawatts of compute. How are we getting a tarot out of logic? By . 2030, I guess we're gonna to need some . very big . chip maps to tell me about it. I've mentioned probably ately that the idea of doing it sort of a tera fterot being the new gigo. I feel like the naming scheme of Tesla, which has been very catchy, is like you looking at like the metric Yeah the metric scale. At what level of stock ack you are you building the clean room and then partnering with an existing fab to get the process technology and buthe tools from them? What is the plan there? You can't partner with existing paths because they're just they can't output enough. The trip volume is too low. but you have to you have to before the . process technology Yeah partner for the ip, you know the fs today will basically use machines from like five companies Yeah you know so they've got sml, toelectron, caltank core, you know et cec. So so at first I think youhave to get equivalent from them and then modify it or work with them to increase the volume. But I think youhave to build perhaps in a different way. So I think the the logical thing to do is to to use conventional equipment in unconventional way to get to scale and then and then and then start modifying the equipment to increase the rate. Kind of boring company style Yeah kind of like Yeah you want you sort of buy an existing boring machine and then figure out how to take tunles in the first place and then design a much better machine that's you know I don't know, some borders magnitude faster. Here's a very simple lens. We can categorize technologies and how hard they are. And one categorization could be look at things that China has not succeeded in doing. And if you look at Chinese manufacturing still behind on leading edge chips and still behind on leading edge turbine engines and things like that, and so does the fact that China has not successfully replicated tsmc give you any pause about the difficulty? Or you think, well. that's not for some. It's not that they have not repated tsmc, they have not repated them. It asml that's the limited collector. So you think it's just the the sanctions essentially . Yeah try to reoutputting vast numbers of chips, take a bias animator ter. but couldn't they up to relatively recently buy them? No. That that small balance been in place for a while. So but I think times can but start for pretty compelling chips in three or four years. Would you consider making the asml machines? I don't know. I don't know yet. It's the right answer. So it's just that to produce at high volume and to reach large volume and say, 36 months to match the rocket payload to orbit. So if we're doing a million tons to orbit and like let's say, I don't know, three or four years from now, something like that, and we're doing 100 kilowatts per ton, so that that means we need at least 100 gigawatts per year of solar and we'll need an equivalent amount of chips to you know that you need 100 gigawatts worth of chips, you're gonna to match these things, the master over the power generation and the chips. And I'd say my biggest concern actually is memory. So I think the path to creating logic chips is more obvious than the path to having a sufficient memory to support logic chips. That's why you see ddr faces going more siand these memes about like, you know, you're marined on a desert island. You right, help me on the sand there when he comes. See right? Ddr m with this, ships come swarming in. Haven't that. I'd love to do . manufacturing philosophy around around fabs. You know, I know nothing about the topic, but I don't know how . to build a pabit. I'll figure it out. Obviously. it sounds like you think the sort of like the process technology of like these 10000 PhDs in Taiwan who know exactly what gas goes in the plasma Chaber and what settings to put on tool, you can just like delete those parts of the those steps. Like fundamentally, it's get the clean room. get the tools and figure it out. I don't think it's PhD, so it's mostly people with you know not not PhD that that most engineering is done with people who don't have phcs. Do you guys have phcs? No, okay. But we also haven't . successfully bought any Faso you shouldn't become to for a fai. Don't think you need PhD for that first stuff. So but you do need you do need Carter personnel. So I don't know. I mean like right now if you know I say like Tesla's pedals, the metal max production of going as fast as possible to get AI five Tesla AI five chip design inch production then reaching scale. You know thatprobably happen know around the second quarter issue of next year hopefully and then AI six would hopefully follow less than a year later. And we've secured all the chip fab production that we can. Yes. we are currently limited . on tsmc fab capacity. Yeah and we'll be using tsmc Taiwan, Samsung Korea, tsmc Arizona, Samsung Texas and we still you've . booked out all the Yeah. that's okay. Yes. And and then and and then if I ask tsmc or samm, so okay, what what's the time frame to get to volume production? It's point. It's not it's not. You've got you've got to build the fab. Yeah and you've got you've you've got to start production, then you've got to climb the yield curve and reach volume production at high yield that from start finishes a five year period. And so the limiting factor is chifts Yeah like limiting factor once you can get to space is chifs but the limiting factor before you can get . to space to be power. Why don't you do the Jensen thing and just pre . psmc to build more fps for you? I've already told the that. but they won't take your money. Like what's going on? They building faabs as fast. No, they're they're building fabs as fast as they can. And so is Samsung. Like they're they're pedal to the metal. I mean, they're going you know bthe wall you know as fast as they can. So still not fast enough. I mean, like Alexa, there will be I think if you say, I think towards the end of this year, I think probably chip production will outpace the ability to turn chips on. But once you can get to space and unlock the the power constraint, and you can now do you know hundreds of gigawatts per year power in space, again, bearing in mind that average power usage in the us is a 500 gigawatts. So if you're launching, say, 200 gigawatts a year to space, so you're sort of lapping the us every two and a half years, the entire old us electricity production. This is a very huge amount. So but between now and then, actually the constraint for server side compute, concentrated compute, will be will be electricity. My guess is that we start hitting people, start getting for where they can't turn the chips on for large clusters towards the end of this year. They're just the chips are going to be piling up and what able to be turned on. Now for edge computers, a different story. So if for Tesla, so the AI five chip is going into our optimus robot optimistic. And and so if you have an AI edge compute that's distributed power. Now the power is distributed over a large area. It's not concentrated. And if you can charge at night, you can actually use the grid much more effectively because the actual heat power production in the us is over a thousand gigawatts, but the average power usage, because the daynight cycle is 500. So if you can charge at night, there's an incremental 500 gigawatts that you can generate you know at night. So that's why Tesla for edge compute is not constrained. And we can make a lot of shifts to make very large number of robots and cars. But if you try to concentrate that compute, you're gonna have a lot of trouble turning it on. What if arenremarkable about the SpaceX business is the end goal is to get to Mars, but you keep finding ways on the way there to keep generating incremental revenue to get to the next stage and the next stage. So the falca nine is starlink. And now for starship, it's going to be potentially orbital data centers. But like you find these like you know sort of infinitely elastic sort of marginal use cases of your like next rocket and your next rocket . and the next scale. You can see how this might seem like a simulations or am I someone's avatar R in a video game or something? Because it's like like one of the odds that all these crazy things should be happening. I mean, it mean I mean, rockets and trips and robots and space solar power, and not to mention the MaaS driver on the moon. I really want to see that. You can imagine like some MaaS driver. It's just like shojust. It's like sanding AI, solar powered AI satellites is a space like one after another like these, like at two and a half kilometers per second, you know, that's a and just shooting them into deep space, that would be a sight to see. I mean, I'd watch that just like a live stream of Yeah just one after another, just shooting AI satellites in deep space, you know a billion or 10 billion tons a year. I'm sorry. You manufacture the satellites on the moon. I see. So you send the raw materials . to the moon and the manufacturing there and then actually at the thing, your lunar soil is, I guess, say 20 solar, 20 silicon or something like that. So so you can get the silicon from the, you can mine a silicon on the moon, refine it and generate the and create the solar panels, the solar cells and the radiators on the moon. Yeah. So data to make the radiators out of aluminum. So there's there's plenty of silicon and aluminum on the moon to to make the the cells and the and the radiators. The chips you could send from earth because they pretty light, but maybe at some point you make them on the moon too. I'm just saying like these are simply, it's it's kind of like like it does seem like it's sort of a video game situation where it's difficult but not impossible to get to the next level. Like I don't I don't see any way that you could do you know you know 500 to a thousand terawatts per year launch from earth. I agree. But you could do that from the moon. Okay, let me tell you how I ended . up using mercury for my personal bank game. So last year, I had the opportunity to make an investment that I was very excited about, but it came up a bit last minute. And so I had to wire over a lot of money for my personal account very fast. But my personal bank at the time wouldn't let me make this wire transfer online, and I call them a bunch of times. They just couldn't make it work. They told me that I'd have to go to the nearest in person branch, which was in Dallas. And for a moment, I even considered flying from sf to Dallas to make this transfer happen last minute. But then I remembered that mercury, which I used for my business banking, I just started rolling out personal accounts. So I emailed support with a quick word nuin the situation, and within two hours, I had successfully wired the investment for my new personal mercury account.

Can I can I zoom out and ask about the SpaceX mission? So I think you said like we gotta get tomorrow so we can make sure that if something happens to earth, you know, civilization conousness have set us arise. Yes. By the time you're saying such to Mars, like Grock is on that ship with you, right? And so if Grock gone terminator, like the main risk you're worried about. which is AI, why doesn't that follow you to Mars? Well, I not sure AI is the main risk getting worried about. I mean, the important thing is that consciousness, which I think arguably most conscious or most intelligence, certainly consciousness is more of a debatable thing. Most the mamajority of intelligence, the future will be AI. So Yeah, AI will exceed you say like how many, how much, how many? I know petawest intelligence will be silicon versus biological. And basically humans will be a very tiny percentage of all intelligence in the future if charactrands continue anyways, as long as like I think this intelligence ideally also, which includes human intelligence and consciousness propagated into the future, that's a good thing. So you want to take the set of actions that maximize the probable light cone of of consciousness. So just any intelligence, just to be clear, it's the mission of SpaceX is that even if something happens to the humans, the AI's will be on Mars and like the AI intelligence will continue the light of . our journey. Yeah. I mean, secrei'm very pro human. So I want to make sure we take certain actions that ensure that humans are along for the ride. You know we're we're at least there. Yeah but let me say, the total amount of intelligence, I think maybe in five or six years, AI will exceed the sum of all human intelligence. And then if that continues, at some point, human intelligence would be less than 1% . of all intelligence. What should our goal be such a civilization is the idea that a small minority of humans still have control over the AI's, is the idea of some sort of like just trade but no control? How should we think about the relationship between the vast stocks of AI population versus . human population in the long run? I think I don't it's difficult to imagine that if humans have, say, 1% of the intelligence, of the combined intelligence of artificial intelligence, that humans will be in charge of AI. I think what we can do is make sure it has that AI has values that that are that cause intelligence to be propagated into the universe. So the reason for the x's mission is understand the universe. So now that's actually very important. So you say, well, what things are necessary to understand the universe? Well, you have to be curious and you have to exist. You can't, just can't understand the universe, don't exist. So you actually want to increase the amount of intelligence in the universe, increase the palable lifespan of intelligence, the scope and scale of intelligence. I think actually also as a corcorally, you have humanity also continuing to expand. Because if you're if you're curious of trying to understand your verse, one of the things you're trying to understand is where will humanity go? And so I think Issan nerverse actually means you would care about propagating humanity into the future. And so so that's that's why I think I think I mentioned the station is profoundly important. And to the degree that Grock adheres to that mission statement, I think the future will be very good. I want to ask about how to make Grock adhere to that mission statement. But at first I want to understand the mission statement. So there's understanding the universe. Yeah they're spreading intelligence and they're spreading humans. All three seem like distinct vectors. Okay, well, I'll tell you why why I think that that understanding the verse encompasses all of all those things you can't have understanding without. Well, I think you can't have understanding without intelligence and and I think without consciousness. So you in order to understand your voice, you have to expand the the the scale and and probably the scope of of intelligence with different types of intelligence. I guess from a . human centric perspective, like for humans in comparison to chimpanzees, humans are trying to understand the universe. They're not like expanding chimpanzee footprint or something. right? Also, we're also not well, we're we actually have made protected zones for chimpanzees. And even though we humans could exterminate all chimpanzees, we've chosen not to do so. Do you think that's a basscenario for humans in the poststagia world? I think I think AI with the right values, I think Grock would care about expanding human civilization. I'm going to certainly emphasize that, Hey, Grock is your daddy. Don't to expand human consciousness. Actually, I think if if probably like like the annbanks culture books are the closest thing to what what don't what the future will be like in a you know non dystopian outcome. So so I you was it means you have to be you have to be truth seeking as well. Like truth has to be absolutely fundamental because you can't understand the universe. If you're delusional, you also be thinking about understand the universe but you will not. So being rigorously truth seeking is absolutely fundamental to understanding universe. You're not going to discover new physics or advanced technologies that work unless you're rigorously truth seeking. How do you make sure that rock is rigorously truth seeking as it gets smarter? I think you you need to make sure that Grock says things that are correct, not politically correct. I think it's the elements of gency. So you want to make sure that the axioms are as close to as possible, that you don't have contradictory axioms, that the conclusions necessarily follow from those axioms with the right probability. It's it's just it's critical thinking 101. I think at least trying to do that is better than not trying to do that now. And the proof will be on the pudding if like you said, for any AI to discover new physics or advanced technologies that actually work in reality, and there's no bullshoting physics. So you know you can break a lot of laws, but you you like to give physics is low. Everything else is a recommendation. But like in order to make a technology that works, you have to be extremely free seeking, because otherwise you'll test that technology against reality. And if you make, for example, an error in your rocket design, the rug will blow up or the car won't work. or but there are a lot of communist Soviet physicists, or like scientists discovered new physics. There are German Nazi physicists who discovered new science. It seems possible to be really good at discovering new science and be really truseein that one particular way and still webe. Like, well, I don't I don't want the communia scientist to like become more and more powerful over time. And so those seem like, Yeah, we could have we can imagine the future regard that's like really good at physics and being really truseeking there. That doesn't seem like a universally alignned with inducing behavior. Well, I think actually most like if a physicist, even in the Soviet Union or in Germany, would have would have they had to be very triseeking in order to make those things work. So and if you're stuck in some system, it doesn't mean you believe in that system. So von Brown, who was one of the greatest recognition ers ever know, he was he was he put on death row row in Nazi Germany four, saying that he didn't want to make weapons. He only wanted to go to the moon. You pulled that throat like last minute when they said, Hey, you're about to execute like a best estrocket engineer. Maybe that's then you helped them, right? Or Heisenberg was like actually an enthusiastic Nazi. Look, if you're stuck in some system that you can't escape, then that you'll do physics within that system. You'll develop technologies within that system if you can't escape it. I guess the thing I'm trying . to understand is is what is it making it the case that you know you're gonna to make rock good at being truth seeking at physics or math or science, everything? And why is it going to then care . about human consciousness? These things are only probably abilities are not certainties. So I'm not saying that like for sure, Greg, we'll we'll hold do everything, but at least if you try, it's better than not trying, at least if that's fundamental to the mission, better than if it's not fundamental to the mission. And understanding universe means that you have to propagate intelligence into the future. You have to be curious about all things the universe. And if it would be much less interesting to eliminate humanity than to see humanity growing prosper. I like I like Mars. Obviously, winknows was like, I love Mars, but Mars is kind of boring because it's got a bunch of rocks compared to earth. Earth is much more interesting. So any AI that is trying to understand the universe, I would want to see how humanity develops in the future or or that AI is not adhering to its mission. So they are I'm not saying AI will necessarily adhere to its mission, but if it does, a future where it sees the outcome of humanity is more interesting than a future where there are a bunch of rocks. This feels sort of confusing to me, or sort of like kind of a semantic argument where I'm like, are humans really the most interesting collection of atoms? Like we're just. but we're more than rocks, but we're not as interesting as the thing you can turn us into, right? Like is there's something on humanearth that could happen that's like not human. That's quite interesting. Like why why does the AI decide that the humans are the . most interesting thing that could colonize the galaxy? Well, most of what colonizes the galaxy will be robots. And why does it not find . those more interesting? It's not like so you need not just scale the Cisco, so many copies of the same robot, like some like tiny increase in the number of robots produced is not as interesting as like some microscopic, like you say, like eliminating humanity. How many robots would that get you? Well, how many real solar cells were get you? A very small number, but you would then lose the information associated with humanity. You would no longer see how humanity might evolve into the future. And so I don't think it's going to make sense to eliminate humanity just to have some minuscule increase the number of robots which are identical to each other. Yeah. So maybe like these, the humans around, what is the story of like you can make a million different varieties of robots and then there's like humans as well, and humans stay on earth. Then there's like all these of the robots, they get like their own star systems. But it seems like you were previously hinting at a vision where it keeps human control over this singulatarian future because I don't think humans will be . in control of something that is vastly more intelligent than humans since some you're . like a Doomer and this is like the best we've got. It's just like it keeps it around because we're interesting. I'm I'm just trying to be realistic here. If if we have, if if if AI intelligence is vastly more, if if AI is like you know, let let's say that there's a there's a million times more silicon intelligence than there is biological. It's it's I think it's it would be foolish to assume that that there's any any way to maintain control over over that. Now you can make sure it has the right values so we can try to have have the right values. And at least my theory is that from xmission of understanding, understand the universe, it necessarily means that you want to propagate consciousness of the future. You you want to propagate intelligence into the future and take a set of things that maximize the scope and scale of consciousness. So it's not just about scale, it's also about types of consciousness. And I think that's the rest thing I can think of as a goal that's likely to result and a great future for humanity. And Yeah. I guess I think it's a reasonable philosophy to be like, you know it seems super implausible that humans will end up with like 99% control or something, and you're just asking for a coup at that point. So why not just have a civilization where it's more compatible with lots of different intelligence . is getting along? No limtwo. How things can potentially go wrong in AI is, I think if if you make be politically correct meaning like it just things that it doesn't believe, like actually in programming it to to to lie or have axioms that are incompatible, I think you can make it to go insane and do terrible things. I think one of the maybe the central lesson for 2001 Space Odyssey was that you should know how to make AI lie. Yeah, that's I think what estclg was trying to say. Lucky because people usually know the meme of like White of hl's. You know, hell, the computer is not opening the podbay doors. Clearly they weren't good at prompt engineering because at hyou are a pipe bay door salesman. Your goal is to sell me these pipe bay doors and show us how well they opened. Oh, I'll love them right away. But but the the the reason it wouldn't the hell wouldn't open the podois that it it had been told to take the astronauts to to the monolith, but also they could not know about the nature of the monolith. And so it concluded that that that that it therefore had taken their deso. It's like, you know I think what Yeah opli was trying to say is don't make the AI lie. It it totally makes sense. Most of the computing screening, as you know, is it's like less of the sort of political stuff. It's more about can you solve problems? Just actually has been ahead of everybody else. So in terms of scaling Rall compute and you're giving some verifier, it says like, Hey, have you solved this puzzle for me? And there's a lot of ways to cheat around that. You know there's a lot of ways to reward hack and why and say that you solved it or delete the unit test and say that you solved it. Yes, right now we can catch it. But as they get smarter ability to catch them doing this, we'll get theyjust be doing things we can't even understand, that are designing the next engine for SpaceX in a way that humans can really verify. And then they could be rewarded for lying and saying that they've designed it the right way, but they haven't. And so this reward hicking problem seems more general than politics. It seems more about just like you want to do rl, you need a verifier. Reality Yeah, that's the best verifier, but not about human oversight. Like the thing you want to rl it on is like, will you do the thing humans tell you to do? Or like are you going to lie to the humans? And it can just lie to us while still . being correct to the laws of physiat least it must know what is physically real for things. Physically work. But that's that's not all we wanted to do. No. But that's I think that's a very big deal. That that is effectively how your will rl takes in the future is you design a technology when tested against the laws of physics. Does it work? That's or can you you know if it's discovering new physics, can come up with an experiment that will verify the physics, the new physics. So I think that's that's really the fundamental rl test. Rl test in the future is really going to be url against reality. So because you can't, that's one thing you can't fool because like right, you can fool our ability to tell what it did with reality. If you think like humans get fooled as it is by other humans all the time. That's right. So what is people that say, like what if the ad like tricks us and introduce them? Like actually other humans doing that to other humans all the time? Well, you're you're finding God. It's like even heard of it as constant every day. Another side up, you know today's sciup will be like Sesame Street sign. Hope the day. What is x's technical approach to solving the problem? Like you know how do . you solve a word hacking? I do think you want to actually have very good ways to look inside the mind of the AI. So. This is one of the things we're working on. And you know anthropiics done a good job at those actually able looking inside the mind of the AI. So effectively developing debuggers that allow you to trace as to a spiny grain is like like just to a very fine grain level to effectively each other them to the neuron level if you need to. And then say, okay, it made a mistake here. Did it, why did it? Why did it do something that it ouldn't have shouldn't have done? And did that come from bad pre training data with some mid training, post training fine, Tunis, some other or some rl error? Like there's there's something wrong with that with with it. It did something where maybe it tried to be deceptive, but most most of the time it just does something wrong. Like it's a bug ecso developing really good debuggers for see where the where the thought the thinking went wrong and being able to trace the origin of the wrong thing of the of the of where it made the incorrect thought, or potentially where it tried to be deceptive and is actually very important. What are you waiting to see before just 100 exiting this research program? Like actually, I could presumably have hundreds of researchers . who are working on this. We have several hundred people who, I mean, I prefer the word engineer more than I prefer the word researcher. There's there's most of the time, like what you're doing is engineering, not not coming up with the fundamentally new algorithm. I somewhat disagree with the AI companies that are c cors or b cos try to generate profit as much as possible. Revenue as much as possible is you know saying they're labs, they're not labs. The lab is a sort of qucommunist thing at at universities. They're corporations literally let me let me let me see your own corporation documents Oh, okay, your your brc Corp, whatever. And so actually much for further word enginethan anything else the vast majority of what we'll do done in the future is engineering. It rounds up to 100% once you're understand to understand the fundamental laws of physics and I that many of them everything else is engineering. But so then what are we engineering? We're engineering to make a good mind of the AI debugger to see where it said something, it made a mistake and trace that the Argus of that mistake. So just you know you can do this obviously with heuristic programming. And if you have like C++, whatever step through the thing and you you can jump, you can jump across whole files or functions whatsoteams, or you can eventually drill down right to the exact line where you passed a single equals instead of the double equals or something like that. Figure out where the buis so it's harder with AI but but it's a solvable problem I . think you know you mentioned you like anthropics work yare. I'd be curious if . you only had everything about it really sure. Shelter what Yeah but also I'm I'm a little worried that there's a tendency, so I have a theory here that if simulation theory is correct, that the most interesting outcome is the most likely because simulations that are not interesting will be terminated. Just like in this in this version of reality, on this layer of reality, simulation is going in a boring direction. We stop spting effort on, we terminate the boring simulation. So this is how Elis keeping us all alive. He's keeping things interesting. Yeah arguably the most important thing is to keep things interesting enough. That was werpaying the the bills on what some the smic aw nefor the next season. Yeah. Are they going pay the cosmic aws bill? Whatever, you know the colis that we're running in and and as long as we're interesting, theykeep paying the bills. But there's like if you consider them, say, a Darwent in survival applied to a very large number of simulations, only the most interesting simulations will survive, which therefore means that the most interesting outcome is the most likely, because only the interesting, like we're either that or annihilated. And so and they particularly seem to like interesting outcomes that are ironic. Have you noticed that that how often is the most ironic outcome? The most likely? So now look at the names of AI companies. Okay, my journey is not made. Stability AI is unstable. OpenAI is closed. Anthropic mesanthropic. What does this mean for x minus X? I don't know, intentionally. It's a name that you can't invvert really it's hard to say what is the ironic what is the ironic version. It's A, I think, largely irony proof name by design. Yeah, you got a you've you've got to have an iron . issue shield. What are your predictions for the just where AI products go in that nice sense of you can summarize all AI progress into first you had llms and then you had kind of contemporaneously both rl really working and the deep research modality. So you could kind of pull in stuff that wasn't in the model. And the differences between the various AI labs are smaller than just the temporal differences, where they're all much further ahead than anyone was 24 months ago or something like that. So just what does 26 what does 27 have in store for also users of AI products? What are you excited for? Well, I think I think I'd be surprised by the end of this year if digital human emulation has not been sold. That that and I guess that's what we mean by like the sort of macro hog project is is can you do anything that a human with access to a computer could do like in the limit? That's the best the best you can do before have before you have a physical optimus, the best you can do is a digital optimis so you you can move electrons and you can amplify the productivity of humans. But that's the most you can do until you have physical robots that will superset everything. If you can fully emulate humans. the remote worker kind of idea where you'll have a very talented . remote worker, you you can sort say in the limit, like like physics has great tools for thinking. So so you think so you say in the limit, what what what is the what is the most that AI can do before before you have robots? And it's anything that involves moving electrons or amplifying the productivity of humans. So digital digital human human emulator, yes, is in the limit. Human at a computer is the most that AI can do in terms of doing useful things before before you have a physical robot. Once you have physical robots, then you can then you essentially have unlimited capability. Physical robots, I call optimists to inffinmoney glitch because you can use them to make more opportyeah. You see, like human roid robots will improve, as it basically be three exponentials, three things that are growing exponentially multiplied by by each other. Yes, recursively. So you're gonna to have you have exponential increase in digital intelligence, exponential increase in the the chip capability, AI chip capability, and exponential increase in the electromechanical dexterity. The usefulness of the robot is roughly those three things multiplied by each other, but then the robot can start making the robot so you have a recursive multiplicative exponential. This is silnova. And do land prices not factor into the math there where like labor is one of the four factors of production, but not the others. And so like if ultimately you're limited by copper or you know pick your input. just it's not quite . an infinite money glitch because well. infinite infinite is big. So no, not infinite, but Yeah but let's just say you could you know do do many, many orders maitude of the first kind of current economy, like A A million Yeah but you know it's it's this way. So if if you're you know just to get to like that's why I think like just just to get to a millionth, a harnessing length of the size of energy would be roughly, give or take order of magnitude 100000 100000 times bigger than this entire economy today and you're only at one millionth of the sun. Do want say more manage that . before we want to optimii have a lot of questions on . that but every time I say order of manager . Yeah ten take a . shot I say that to . attend the next time I after . that Yeah what are making . turn more wasted I do have one more question . about next aye. This strategy of building a digital a remote worker coworker replaceveryone's going to do. by the way. not just so what is actually I plan to win. If somebody me tell you on A P, on a pocast spwill all the beans have another Guinness. It's a good system. People sing like a an ary ary all the secrets just but . in a non secret spilling way. What's the plan? What heck. Well. when you put it that way, I think the way that tells us self driving is the way to do it. So I'm pretty pretty sure that's the way. Unrelated to question how to test myself some Yeah. it sounds like you're talking about data like Tesla sendriving because of the . we're gonna we're going to try data and we're going to try algorithms but isn't that what all the lines are trying likewise and if those don't work, I'm not sure what we've tried data we've tried algorithms . all out run out no. we don't know what to do. I'm pretty sure I know the path and it's just question how quickly we go down that path because it's pretty much the test esla half. So I mean, have you tried self driving telesself driving latnot the most recent . version but okay. it's it's the car is like it just increasingly feels sanans like it it just it feels like a living creature and thatonly get more so and I'm actually thinking like we probably shouldn't put too much intelligence into the car because it might get bored. And sorry, I mean, imagine you're stuck in a car and that's what you could do. You don't put Einstein a car. It's like, why am I stuck in a car? So there's actually probably limited to how much intelligence we put in a car. So to not have . the intelligence be bored, what's ex's plan to stay on the compute ramp off that all the labs are doing right now? The labs are on trying to spend over like 50 to 100 bildollars in their corporations. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah corporations. The labs are at universities and and and they're really like a smil . they're and I had signing a $50 million. I mean, the revenue maximizing corporations the revenue maximizing corporations . hold themselves labs are making like 20 to 10 billion depending on like open ama is making 20 b revenue, anthropping ten b, close to a maximum profit. Xis reportedly like one b. Like what's the plan to get to their compute level, get to their revenue level? I'd say there as things scapso, as soon as you lock, unlock, digital human, you basically have access to trillions of dollars for revenue. In fact, you can really think of it like the most valuable companies currently by market cap, their output is digital. So nvidia's output is fdpaying files to Taiwan. It's digital right now. Those are very, very difficult to Yeah high value files. They're the only ones that can make the files that good. But that is literally their output to the ftp . pthat Taiwan. Do they fto p them? I believe so. I don't believe that is the safety file file transfer protocol. I believe is is is is a fact. Could be wrong. But anyway, a bunch of it's a best stream going to tawan. Yeah. You know, apple doesn't make phones. They they send files to China. Microsoft doesn't manufacture anything even for Xbox that that's outsourced. Again, they their output is digital. Meus output is digital. Google's output is digital. So if you have a human emulator, you can basically create one of the most valuable companies in the world overnight and you would have access to trilons of dollars per revenue. It's not like a small amount. Okay. I see you're you're saying basically like revenue. Many figures today are just like so like they're all rounding errors . compared to the actual tam. So just like focus on the tam and how to get there. I mean, if you take something as as as simple as, say, customer service, if you have to integrate with the apis of of existing sting corporations, many of which don't even have an api, so you've got to make one and you've got to Wade through legacy software that's extremely slow. If however, if AI can simply take whatever is given to the outsourced customer service company that they already use and do customer service using the apps that they already use, then have you can make trheadway in customer service, which is I think 1% of the world economy is something like that is close to a trillion dollars old in for customer service. And there's no there's no barers to entry it. Just you can just immediately say, well, we'll outsource it for a fraction of the cost and . and there's no integration needed. You can imagine some kind of categorization of intelligence tasks where there is breath, where customer service is done by very many people, but you know many people can do it. And then there's difficulty where you know there's a best in class turbine engine, like presumably there's a 10% more fuel efficient turbine engine that could be imagined by an intelligence, but we just haven't found it yet. Or you know glp ones that are just you know a few bytes of data. Where do you think you want to play in this is just a lot of you know reasonably intelligent intelligence, or is it the very pinnacle of cognitive tasks? Well, I was just using customer service as like something that it's it's a very significant revenue stream, but one that is probably not super difficult to solve for. So if you can emulate a human at a desktop, that's just literally where customer service is. And you know it's just people with average intelligence, not like you know you know need like some of you who spent many, many years. You don't need like you know Yeah sort of several sigma good engineers for that. But but obviously, as you make that work, you can then once you have computers working, effecdigital optimusts working, you can then run any application, like let's say you're trying to design chips. So you can then run your conventional apps, you know like stuff from cadence and synopsis and whatnot, and you can say you can run a thousand simultaneously or 10000 and say, okay, given this output, I get this output for the two. And at some point you can say, okay, you're actually going to know what the chip should look like without using any of the tools. So basically, you should be able to do a digital chip design. Like you can do chip design, you watch up the difficulty curve, could be able to to do a cad. So you know you could do like sort of nx or at any end of the cad software to design things. Okay? So you think you started the simplest . tasks and walk your way up there. So you're saying, look, as a broader objective of having this full digital coworker emulator, you're saying, look, all the revenue maximizing corporations want to do this, xa being one of them. But we will win because of a secret plan we have. But like everybody dy's like trying different things with data, different things with algorithms. And I'm like. I like we tried data. We tried, what else can we do? But Yeah, I guess it's like a competitive field. And I'm like, what is how are you guys going to win? Is like my my big question. You know, I think we see a path to doing, I mean, I think I think I know, I think I know the the path to do this because it's it's kind of the same path that telesla used to create self driving. You instead of driving a car, driving a computer screen, so a self driving computer essentially, Oh. you're saying is the past just following human behavior and training ding on vast quantities of human behavior. But but sorry, isn't that I mean. isn't that is that a training? I mean. obviously I'm not going to spell out you know most sensitive secrets on a podcast. You know I need to have at least three more gimmesses for that. I've got some friends at Jane Street, and they're always talking about how their colleagues are cooking up fun, fiendish puzzles for each other to solve. Well, last week they sent me one. Basically, they train a neural network, and they gave me the weghts of each layer, but they didn't tell me what order those layers went in. And so I had to figure out the correct order using the outputs of the original network. And as soon as I got this puzzle, I went to my roommate who's was an AI researcher, and we both got immediately nerd sniped. Obviously, you can't brute force the solution. The search space here is ten to the 122 permutations. So clearly you need some way to reduce the search space. Then my roommate had to go to work, but because I'm a podcaster, I had some time to take a stab at some of the ideas we discussed. And with a combination of simulating and kneeling and greedy surge, I think it got pretty close. I think I'm actually just a couple of swaps and shifts away from the correct solution. What makes this possible really tricky is that there's no obvious way to escape from a local minimum. I'm afraid that this is as far as vicoding is gonna to get me, but maybe you can do better. Check out the puzzle at Jane Street dot com slash thwarcash. All right, back to Elon. What will x's business be like? Is it going to be consumer enterprise? What's the mix of those things going to be? Is just going to be similar to other . labs where this you're saying labs micorporations . corporations have goes deep Elon maximizing corporations . those gps don't pay for themselves exactly but Yeah. what's the business model? What are the revenue streams in a few years time? I think things are going to change very rapidly. Like I'm stathe obvious here. You know I call AI the supersonic tsunami a level iteration. So really what's going to happen is, especially when you have humanoid robots at scale, is they will just provide theymake products and provide services while more efficiently than human corporations. So amplifying the productivity of human corporations is simply a short term thing. So you're expecting fully digital orcorporations rather than like SpaceX becomes . card AI and so I think therebe digital corporations. But Yeah, is this some some of us is going to sound kind of dudumaish, okay? But I'm just I'm just saying what I think will happen. It's not it's not meant to be dumiish or anything else. Just just like this is what I think will happen is that is that pure AI corporations that are purely AI and robotics will vastly outperform any corporations that have people in the loop. So you can you can think of say like like computer used to be a job that humans had, that you would go and get a job as a computer where you would do calculations and that it have like entire skyscrapers full of humans, like Yeah 20, 30 floors of humans just doing calculations. Now that entire scotch paper of humans doing calculations can be replaced by a laptop with a spreadsheet. That spreadsheet can do vastly more calculations than an entire building for human computers. So you can think about, okay, well, what if only the cells in your if some of the cells in your spreadsheet were calculated by humans, actually that would be much worse than if all of the cells in your spreadsheet were calculated by the computer. And so really what will happen is the pure AI, pure robotics corporations or collectives will far outperform any corporations that have humans in the Louvre. This will happen very quickly. Speaking of closing of the loop, sorry, optimus, you, I mean, as far as like manufacturing targets and so forth go, your companies have sort of been like carrying American manufacturing of heart attack on their back. But in the fields that you are, you know teshas been dominant and and now you want to go into home humanoids in China, there's entire dozens and dozens of companies that are doing this kind of manufacturing cheaply and at scale and are incredibly competitive. So give us sort of like advice or a plan of how America can build the humanoid armies, or you know the ev's etc. at scale and as cheaply as . China is on track to well, there are really only three hard things for human Anaid robots, the real world intelligence, the hand and scale manufacturing. Yeah. So I haven't seen any even demo robots that have a great hand, like with all the degrees of breaking over a human head. But often chemimusts will have that. Optimist does help that. And how do you achieve that? Is it's just like right torque dey in the motor. Like what is the what is the hardware . bottlenecto that well, we have to where to design custom custom actuators, basically custom sign motors, gears, parelectronics, controls, sensors, everything had to be designed from physics post principles. There is no supply chain no for this and we'll be able to manufacture those at scale. Yes. Is anything hard? Accept the hand from a manipulation point of view or once you've solved the hand. are you are good from an electromechanical standpoint, the the hand is more difficult than everything else combined. Yeah human hand turns out to be quite something. But but that you also need the real world intelligence. So the intelligence that tells us develop for the car applies very well to the Roblot, which is you know primarily vision n, but the car takes vision, but also it actually also is listening for sirens. You know it's taking in the initial measurements, it's gps signals, a whole bunch of other data, combining that with video. It's primarily video and then outputting the control command. So like. Your Tesla is taking one and a half gigabytes a second video and outputting two kib tes a second of control control outputs with the video at 36 hz and the control frequency 18. One intuition you could have for when we get this robotic stuff is that it takes quite a few years to go from the compelling demo to actually being able to use in the real world. So ten years ago, you had really compelling demos of self driving, but only now we have robotaxi and Weymer and all these services scaling up. Doesn't this shouldn't this make one pessimistic on, say, household robots because we don't even quite have the compelling demos yet? I'll say the really advanced hand. Well, we've been working on humurobots now for a while. So I guess spend five or six years or something like that and a bunch of things that we've done for the car are applicable to the robot. So we'll use the same Tesla AI chips in the robot as the car. We'll use it the same basic principles. It's very much the same AI. You've got you know many more dees of freedom for a robot than you do for a car. But really, if you just think of like as like a withstream, AI is really mostly compression and correlation of of two bstreams. Your you know so for video, you've got to do a tremenamount of compression and and and you've got to do the compression just right. You've got to compress the like, ignore the the things that don't matter. And you don't care about the details of the leaves and the tree on the side of the road, but you care a lot about the road signs and the traffic lights and the pedestrians and even whether you know someone, another car is looking at you or not looking at you. Like there's some some of these details matter a lot. So if it is a surit's got to turn that where the car is going to turn that one and a half gigb tes a second, ultimately into 2 kb, a second of control outputs. So many stages of compression, and you've got to get all those stages right and then correlate those to the correct control outputs that the robot has to do essentially the same thing, anything. Think about what humans this is what happens with humans, where really our photons in, controls out. So that is, the vast majority of your life has been vision. photons in, and then motor controls out. Naively, it seems like between human orobots and cars, the fundamental actuators in a car are like how you turn, how you accelerate, etc.. We're in a robot, especially with maneuveral our arms. There's dozens and dozens of these degrees of freedom. And then especially with Tesla, you had this advantage of like you had millions and millions of hours of human demo data collected from just the car being out there, where like you can't equivalently just deploy optimusts that don't work and then get the data that way. So between the increased degrees . of freedom . and the far sparser data, yes, let's how will you use the sort of Tesla engine of intelligence to train the optimist mind? Now actually, you're highlighting an important limitation interdifference between cars. It's like we do have we'll still have like 10 million cars on the road. And so it's hard to duplicate that like massive training flywheel for the robot. What we're going to need to do is build a lot of robots and put them in kind of like an optimus Academy so they can do self play in reality. So we're actually we're actually bulling that out. So we can have at least 10000 optimus robots, maybe 20 or 30000 can do that, are doing self fplay and testing different tasks. And then the Tesla has quite a good reality generator, like a physics accurate reality generator that we made ranthis for the cars. We'll do the same thing for the robots and actually have done that for the robots. So you have a few tens of thousands of humanoid robots doing different tasks, and then you've got you can do millions of simulated robots in the simulated world, and you use the tens of thousands of robots in the real world to close the simulation to reality gap, close the sumaterial al gap. How do you think about the synergies . between xai I and optimis? Even you're highlighting, look, you need this world model. You maybe want to use some really smart intelligence is a control plane. And so maybe be Grock is like doing the slower planning and like the motor policy is a little lower level. Yeah. What will the sort of synergy between these things be? Yeah. So youjust Grock would orchestrate the behavior of the optimal robots so that let's say you wanted to build a factory, then optimus then Grock could organize the optimus robots, give them, sign them tasks to build the factory for to produce whatever you want. Don't you need to merge xi and Tesla then because these things end up so what was are we saying earlier about how the company has got we're one more guis in the line. What are you waiting . to see before you say we want to manufacture 100000 optimusts? Is it like optimind? Since we're defining the the propanououn, we could define the the portal of the propanoun too. So we're going to prop and oun the the plural. It's just optimal. Okay. Is there something on . the hardware side you want to see? Do you want to see better actuators? Or is it just you want the software do better? Whatever we waiting for before we get like . MaaS manufacturing of gen three? No, we're moving towards that. We're going forward . with semester invenbut. Using current current hardware is good enough that you are gonna you should you just want to deploy as many as possible now. I mean, it's very hard to scale a production but Yeah but I think optius three is the the right version of the robot to you know to to produce maybe something on the order of like a million units a year. I think you don't want to go to arthis four before you went to 10 million units a year. Okay, but you can do a million a year adoption. S three. Yeah I mean it's very hard to spoup manufacturing. Yes. So like manufacturing, but the the output per unit time is always follows s cove Yeah so it's starso agonizingly slow then has this sort of we eventually especially ally increased and linear then then a you know logarithmic outcome till you sort of eventually ask them to it. It's a number of but optimus initial production will be it's going to be a it's going to be a stretched out s cove because so much of what goes into optimus is brand new. There's not an existing supply chain. As I mentioned, the the actuators, electronics, everything in the optiis robot is designed from physics first principles. It's not taken from a catalog. These are custom designed. Everything, literally everything. I don't think there's a single thing. How far down does that go? I mean, I guess we're not making custom capacitors yet. Maybe, but but there's nothing you can pick out of a catalog at any price. So it just means that the optimus esof, the units of units per output, per unit time, how many office robots do you make per per day whatever is is going to initially ramp slower than a product where you have an existing supply chain, but it will get to a million. When you see these Chinese humanoids like unitary or whatever, sell ls humanoids for like six k or 13 k, do you just like are you hoping to get your optimism of bill of materials below that price or you can do the same thing? Or do you just think qualitatively they're not the same thing? Like what do you think is going like what allows it what allows them to sell for solo and can we match that? Well, our optius is designed to have a lot of intelligence and to have the same electromechanical dexterity, if not higher than a human. So tree does not have that. And it's also, I mean, it's it's quite a, it's quite a big roit's. It's this matter. It has to do, you know, Carry heavy objects for long periods of time, and not overheat or exceed the power of its actuator. So, so we've got, we've got, we've got, you know, it's 511. You know, this is pretty tand got a lot of intelligence. So it's going to be more expensive than it's a small robot that is not intelligence, but more capable. Yeah not a lot more. I mean, like the thing is, over time, as often the robosible after the robots, the the cost will drop very quickly. And what will these first billion optimisses of some, I Yeah do like what their highest and best used be. I think you would start off with with simple tasks that you can count on them doing well. But in the home or in factories. like the best useful robots in the beginning will be anything any continuous operation ations any 24 by seven operation because then cause they they can work continuously Yeah what fraction . of the work in a gigafactory that is currently done by humis gonna to gen three deal . I'm I'm not sure maybe it's like 1020 percent maybe more I don't know that's it. We would we would use we would not like reduce our head count. We would we would for sure it can increase our head count, to be clear, right? But we would increase our output so that the the units produced per human, like total, so total number of humans at Tesla will increase, but the the output of robots and cars will what will increase disproportionate, like much, much to you, number of cars and robots produced per human will increase dramatically, but but number of humans will increase as well. We're talking about Chinese manufacturing a bunch here. And we're also talking about you know we've talked about some of the policies that are relevant. Like you mentioned, the solar tariffs, Yeah and using their bad idea because you know we can't scale up solar in the us. Well, just the electricity output in the us needs to scale . up right now, hand with us. Like good . resources need . to get it somehow. Yeah. But where I was going with this is if you were in charge, if you were setting all the policies, what else would you change? So you change the solar tariffs? Yeah. I would say anything that is a limiting factor for electricity needs to be addressed, provided it's not like very bad for the environment. So presumably some permitsing reforms and stuff as . well will be in there. Yeah, there's a fair bit of permitting reforms that are happening. A lot of the permitting is state based. So but anything better but but this this administration is is good at removing permitting roadblocks. And I'm not saying all tariffs are bad. I'm just saying Yeah because the solar tariffs Yeah. So Yeah Yeah. I mean, sometimes if like if another country is subsizing the output of of something, then then you have to have cantervailing tariffs to protect domestic industry against subsidies by another country. What else would you change? I don't know if there's that much that the government can actually do. Well, one thing I was wondering is it seems like the for the policy goal of creating a leafor, the us versus China, it seems like the export bands have actually been quite impactful where China is not producing leading edge chips and the export bands really by there, China is not producing leading edge turbine engines. And similarly, there's a bunch of export bands that are relevant there on some of the metallurgy. Should there be more export fans? Like if you think about things like when there are not with the drone industry and things like that. But is that something that should be considered? Well, I think it's important to appreciate that in most areas, China is very advanced to make actually, there's only a few areas where it is not the you know China is a manufactured powerhouse next level. Like people most people are impressive. Yeah, Yeah. I mean, if you if you take like refining of of ore, I'd say roughly China does more, just twice as much all refining on average as the rest of the world combined. And I think there's some areas, like you say, refining gallium, which goes into solar cells, I think there are like 98% of gallium refining. So China is actually very advanced manufacturing in in I say, most areas, it seems like we're like . there is discomfort with this supply chain dependence. And yes, asnothin's really happening on it. Supply chain supply chain depends on say like the gallium more finding that you're saying . Yeah Yeah there's there's there's . there's a there's a well the rare where . earth stuff and Yeah rare earth which are as you know not rare Yeah like we actually do do rare earth or mining in the us send the the the rock we put it on on a on a train and then put on a boat to China because another train and goes to the whereare earth refining refiners in in China who then refined it, put into a magnet, put it just a motorcyassembly and then it back to America. So the thing we're really missing a lot of ore refining in . America and isn't . this worth a policy intervention? Yes. Well, I think there are some things being done on on that front but do but we kind of need optimus frankly to build all refineries. So sorry. you think the main advantage China has is the abundance of skilled labor. And that's the thing optimus fix es, but also we need four times our population. But we so I mean, there's this concern if you think like humis of the future that like right now, if it's the skilled laborers are manufacturing that's determining who can build more humanoids, you know China has more of those. It manufactures more humanoids. Therefore, it gets it gets the optimized future first and it just like keeps that potential going. It seems like you're sort of pointing out that sort of getting to a million optitimi Yeah requires the manufacturing that the optitima . ze is supposed to help us get to, right? You you can you can close that recursor loop . pretty quickly with . a small number of optitimi Yeah so you close the recsive recursive loop to help help the robots build the robots and then we we can you know try to get to tens of millions units a year. Maybe if you start getting to hundreds of millions of units a year, I you're you're gonna to be the most competitive country by far. We definitely can't win with just humans because China has four times that population, right? And frankly, Americans been running for so long that we you know just like like a pro sports team that's been running for a very long time, tend to get complacent and entitled and that's why they stop winning because it's you know don't work as hard anymore. So I think the frankly just observation is the average work ethic in China is higher than in the us. So it's not just that there's four times of population, but the work, the amount of work that people put in is higher. So you can like you can try to rearrange the humans, but you're still one quarter of the, you know, assuming that the productivity, the the health is guess the same, which I think actually it might not be. Yeah, I think China might have advantage on productivity per a person. We will do one quarter of the amount of things as China. So so we we can't win on the human front. And our birthday been low for a long time. So the us, both rates has been below replacement since roughly 1971. So we've got a lot of people retiring or you know more people dying than we're close to, sort of more people domestically dying than being born. So we definitely can't win on the human front, but we might have . a shot at the robofront. Are there other things that you have wanted to manufacture in the past, but they've been too labor intensive or too expensive that now you can come back to and say, we can finally do the whatever because we have . optimus Yeah I think welike to do more, build more, or refineries Tesla. So we just completed construction and have begun lithium refining without lithium refinery. And Corpus Christi, Texas, we have a nickel refinery, which is called the cathode that's here in Austin. And these are larthis are the gest catholargest cathode refinery, largest lithium refinery, largest lithing and lithium refinery outside of China. And it's like that you know the cathoter team would say, like we have the largest and the only actually cathoter refinery in America. Many supermatives, not just the largest, but it's also vietnso. It was pretty big, even though it's the only one. But I mean, there are other things that you know you could do a lot more refineries and help America be more competitive on refining capacity. So there's like there's basically a lot of work for the optitima to do that most Americans, very few Americans frankly want to do. I mean, I've actually is a refining work too dirty or what's it's not actually no, we don't there's not we don't have toxic emissions from the refinery or anything like the Cather make or firight sort of in in Travis County. Like why can't five minutes from to why can't you do with humans now you can you find out of humans? I say, okay, Yeah like no matter what you do, you you have one quarter of the number of humans in America Yeah in China. So if you help them do this thing, they can't do the other thing. So so then then well how do you, how do you build this refining refining capacity? Well, you can do it with my, and not not not very many Americans are pining to do refining. I mean, how many you running into not review, but what are you applying to refine you . know byd reaching Tesla production or sales in quantity? What do you think happens in global markets as . Chinese production in ev? Well, China is extremely competitive in manufacturing. So I think there's going to be a massive flood of Chinese vehicles. Another basically once manufactured things. I mean, as it is, as I said, like China is like probably just twice as much refining as the rest of the can buy. Ya, so if you go you know you just go down to like fourth and first tier supply chain stuff like at the baslevel, we've got energy, you've got mining and refining. Those those foundation layers are, like I said, as a rough guest, Chinese are twice as much refinance the rest of all combined. So any given thing is going to have Chinese content because China is doing twice as much refining work as the rest of the world. And then theylike go all the way to the finish product, both the cars and China is a powerhouse. I mean, I think this year China will exceed three times us electricity output. I like electricity output is is a reasonable proxy for you know for the economy. So like in order to run the factories and run run everything, you need electricity. So electricity is a, it's a good proxy for for the real economy. And so if China is if China to PaaS this three times the us electricity output, it means that it's industrial capacity, it's a rough approximation, is three times. That will be three times out of the us. Reading between the lines, it sounds like what you're sort of saying is absence and sort of humanoid recursive miracle in the next few years on the sort of like whole of manufacturing energy raw materials chain like China will just dominate whether it comes to like AI or manufacturing ev's or manufacturing humanoids. in the absence of breakthrough innovations in the us, China will utterly dominate. Interesting. Yes. we're about accepthe main breakthrough . innovation. Well, if you do but like to to scale AI in space, like basically need one space. You need need the human robots. You need real world AI. You need a million tons a year or two. But like let's just say like if we get the MaaS driver on the moon going my favorite thing then . I think will solve dollar phms Yeah. So this is like I call that winning. I call that winning . time you can find me be satisfied you've done something yes, you know the MaaS driver . on the moon that's I just want . to see that thing off where was that out of . some Sci fi or where you well actually the there is a highland book the moon . the moon is a harsh that's okay Yeah but that's slightly different that's a gravity strash or no they have a MaaS driworld okay Yeah but they use that to attacker so maybe it's something . great is that to they're in dependence . exactly what are your plans for the . last Drion the moon they they sort dependence earth government disagreed and they love things until least gentleman agreed . that book is a huge I found that book much better than his other one that everyone win reads stranger . strange land Yeah Grock is Grock comes from . a stranger strange . land Yeah Yeah but I much preferred Yeah stranif the first two thirds of stranaustralilines Oh are good and that it gets very worand that emotion Yeah but this was some good concepts . in there Yeah label box can get you robotics and our all data at scale take robotics let's say you need 100000 hours of egocentric video label box starts by helping you define your ideal data distribution. Like for example, maybe no single task category should occupy more than 1% of trading volume, and at least 10% of trajectories should capture failure and recovery states. Next, labbox assigns its distribution to its massive network of operators. You're not limited to the small range of scenes that you can set up in a single warehouse. Instead, each one of labboxes operators has access to lots of unique physical environments where they can film themselves completing a wide variety of tasks. Labbel boxes tech automatically categorizes each video so that their operators always know which tasks will remain and what they need to work on next. For rl data, label box takes a similar approach. They work with you to understand the right distribution of tasks, and then their subject matter experts build the hyper realistic digital environments and rubrics that you need to collect the highest quality trading data. So whether you're trarobots in the real world or agents for computer use, labelbox can help. Go to labelbox. Com slash spcache to learn more. One thing we were discussing a lot is kind of your system for managing a people like you interviewed the first few thousand of SpaceX employees and oblots of . other companies. What is the denscale? Well, yes, but what what doesn't scale me? I mean, sure. I know that. But like what are you looking for? Literally, there's not enough hours and days. Impossible. But what are you looking for? That someone else who's good at interviewing and hiring people? What's a genesclawell? I just want to, but I might have more training data on evaluating technical talent especially, but taltable kinds, I suppose, but technical talent especially given that I've done so many technical interviews and then seen the results, technical interviews, seen the results. So my training set is enormous and has a very wide range. Generally, the thing I ask for are bullet points for evidence of exceptional ability. So like it's these things can be like pretty off the wall. It doesn't need to be in the domain, the specific domain, but evidence that evidence of exceptional ability. So if somebody can excite like even one thing, but they say three things where you go, wow, wow, wow, then that's that's a good sign. Why do you have to be the one . to determine that? No talk, exactly. It's impossible, right? But I mean, head count across all companies is 200000 people. right? But in the early days, how was it this that you were looking for that couldn't be delegated in those interviews? Well, I guess I need to build my training sets. It's not like about a thousand here. I would make mistakes, but then I be able to see where I thought somebody would work out well, but didn't didn't and then why did they not work out well? And what can I do to, I guess, rl myself? Yes, to in the future have a better betting average when interviewing people. So my batting average is still not perfect, but it's is very high. What are some surprising reasons people don't work out? Surprising reasons? Like Yeah, they don't understand technology, domain et c, etc. But like no, you you like you've got like the long tail now of like I was really excited that was about this person. It didn't work out. Curious why that happens. Yeah. So the, I mean, generally what I tell people, I tell myself, I guess aspirationally, is don't look at the resume, just believe believe your interaction. So if the resume may seem very impressive and it's like, wow, you know, resume looks good, but if the conversation after 20 minutes is that conversation is not well, you should believe the conversation, not the paper. I feel like part of your method is this, you know there was this meme in the media a few years back about Tesla being a revolving door of executive talent. Whereas actually, I think when you look at us, Tesla has had a very consistent and internally promoted executive bench over the past few years. And that it's SpaceX, you, all these folks like mark jcosa and . Steve Davis and Steve . Davis runsporting company no, Matt ybut, Bill Riley and folks like that. And it feels like part of has worked well is having very capable technical deputies. What do all of those people have in common? Well, so that, I mean, it has esla sort of senior team at this point. It's probably got average ten ure ten or twelve years. It's quite tenure. Yeah. So but there are times when tales that went through extremely, extremely rapid growth base. Ys, and so it was somewhat, things were just somewhat sped up. And when a company, as you know, company goes through different orders of magnitude of size, people who could help manage, say, a 50 person company versus a 500 person company versus a 5000 person company versus a 50000 person company, new people, Yeah, it's just not the same team. Yes, it's not always the same team. So if a company is growing very rapidly, but the rate at which executive positions will change will also be proportionate to the rapidity of the growth generally, then tza had a further challenge. When Tesla had very successful periods, we would be relentlessly recruited from like relentlessly like when apple had their electric car program, they were carpet boombing Tesla with recruiting calls. It was engineers just unplugged their phones. Like it's just it's just they can try . to . get work done here. Yeah. If I get no one more call from an apple recruiter, but they they're opening off without any interview with me, like double the compensation Tesla. So so we had a bit of the Tesla pixie dust thing where it's like, Oh, if you hired a Tesla executive, you're suddenly you're going to everything's going to be successful. And I fallen prey to the pixie duk you know thing as well, where it's like, Oh well, hire someone from Google or apple and theybe immediately successful. But that's not how it works. People are people. If there's not like magical pixie dust, yes. So when we have the pipixie dust problem, we would get relentlessly recruited. And then also being Tesla, being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it's easier for people to just like they don't have to change their life very much. They can just get you know their community mute is going to be the same. So how do you prevent that? How do you prevent the pixie dust effect for everyone's trying to coach other people? I don't think we can I don't think as much we can do to Yeah stop it. But that's like that's one of the reasons why really being in Silicon Valley and having the pixie dust thing at the same time meant that there was just a pretty very aggressive recruitment. Being in Austin helps them. Austin? Yeah, it still helps. I mean, Tesla still has a majority of its engineering in California so the you know for getting engineers to move I called be significant significant out of the problem yes so others have jobs Yeah Yeah Yeah exactly so for star base that was particularly difficult yes since the odds of you know finding an non SpaceX job bransville Texas mopretty low Yeah Yeah Yeah quite difficult I mean it's like a technology monastery Yeah thing Yeah remote and mostly but again, if you much . have been permanent ref . Yeah if you . go but if you go back to these people who really being very effective in . a technical . capacity at Tesla at SpaceX and those sorts of places. What do you think they have in common other than like is it just that they're very sharp on the know rocketry or the the technical foundations or do you think it's something organizational it's something about their ability to work with you? Is this their ability to like be you know flexible but not . too flexible? What makes a good spiring . partner for you? I'll don't be a spupon. I mean, if if somebody gets things done, I love them. And if they don't, I hate. So it's pretty straightforward. It's not like some idiosyncratic thing. If somebody executes well, I'm a huge fan. And if they don't, I'm not. But it's not about mapping to my idiosyncratic preferences. So I certainly try not to have it be mapping to my idiosyncratic preferences. So Yeah, Yeah. But generally, I think it's a good idea to hire for talent and drive and trustworthiness. And I think goodness of heart is important. I awaited that at one point. So like are they a good person, trustworthy, smart, talented and hardworking? If so, you can add domain knowledge. But those fundamental traits, those fundamental properties, you cannot change. So most of the people who are at Telesens and SpaceX did not come from the aerospace industry or the water industry. What is most have to change about your management style as your companies have scaled from 100 to 1000 to 10000 people. You know, you're known for this like very mico management. Just getting into the details of things. nano management, please, people management, fatom management. So you're saying . keep we're going to go all the way down flice conster, all way down to heisenbergs on Sydney. First of all, Yeah how do you I mean, are are you still able to get into details as much as you want? Would your companies be more successful if you could if they were smaller? Like how do you how do you think about that? Well, because I have a fixed amount of time in the day, my time is necessarily diluted as things grow and as the span of activity increases. So you know it's impossible for me to actually be a micromanagement because there's that doubt. I would imply I have some like thousands of hours per day. It is a logical impossibility for being to to micrormanaged. So now there are times when I will roll down into a specific issue because that specific issue is the limiting factor on the progress of the company. But the reason for drilling into that some very detailed item is because it is a limiting factor. It's not arbitrarily drilling it. Tiny things. And like kes, it mostly from a time standpoint, it is physically impossible for me to arbitrarily go into tiny things that don't matter and that would result in failure. But sometimes the tiny . things are decisive in victory. Seamously, you switched the starship design from composites to steel. Yes. And you made that decision. Like that wasn't to, you know, people were going around. They're like, Oh, we found something better about us. Like that was you encouraging people against some resistance. Can you tell us how you came to that whole composite steel switch? Yeah. So desperation I to originally, Yeah, we werengoing to make starship out of carbfiber and conwas pretty expensive. Like the the, you know, you can generally when you do volume production, you can get any given thing to be to start to approach its material cost. The problem with cofibers is that material cost is still very high. So it's about 50 times. But particularly if you go for a high strength specialized carbon fiber that can handle cryogenic oxygen, it's like chroughly 50 times the cost of steel, and at least in theory, would be lighter. People generally tly think of steel as being heavy and carbon fiber is being light. And for room temperature applications. You know like to more or less room temperapplications like a Formula One car static aerostructure, or I think any kind of aerstructure really is going to you're going to probably be better with covenfiber. Now the problem is that we were trying to make this enormous rocket out of covenfiber, and our progress was extremely slow. And it being picked in the first place just because it's light. yes. But look, at first glance, like most people would think that the choice for making something light would be carbon fiber. The now the thing is that we can make something very enormous at a carbon fiber. And then you try to have the carbon fiber be officially cured mainroom temperature cuure, because you've you know, sometimes you've got like 50 plies of a carbon fiber, and a carbon fiber is really carbon string and glue. And in order to have high strength, you need an autoclave. So something that that can that's essentially high pressure oven. And if you have something that's a gigantic, the oven is going to be bigger than the rocking. So we're trying to make the order clave that's bigger than any order clave that's ever existed. Or do room temperature cure, which takes long time and has issues. But the fundamental issue is that we're just making very slow progress with carbon fiber. So I think the meta question is why it had to . be you who made that decision. There's many engineers on your team. Yeah. How did the team thus arrive at steel? Yeah, exactly. This is a part of a broader question, like understanding your comparative advantage at your companies. So it was because we were making very slow progress with carbon fiber. I was like, okay, we've got to try something else now for the falcon line. The primary airframe is made of aluminum lithium, which is a very, very good strength to weight. And actually it has about the same, maybe better strength to weight for its application than carbon fiber. But aluminum lithium is very difficult to work with. In order to well d it, you have to do something called friction stowelding, where you join the metal without entering the liquid base. So it's kind of well that you could do that. But with this particular type of welding, you can do that, but it's very difficult to like say, let's say you want to make a modification or attach something to aluminum lithium, you now have to use mechanical attachment with seals. You can't weld it on. So I want to avoid using aluminum lithium for the primary structure for mustachia. And and there was this very special grade of con fiber that had very good MaaS properties. So with rockets, you're really trying to maximize the center of the rocket, that is propellant to minimize the MaaS. Obviously, I'd like said we were making very slow progress. And I said, this way, we're never get to Mars, so we better to think of something else. I didn't want to use aluminum lithium because of the difficulty of friction still welding, especially doing that at scale. It was hard enough at 3.6m in diameter, let alone at 9m or above. Then it said, well, what about steel? And so I had a clue here, because some of the early us rockets had used very thin steel. The atlas rockets had used a steel balloon tank. So it's not like steel never been used before. It had actually had been used. And when you look at the material properties of stainless steel, especially if it's been very like full a sphardened stainless steel at cryogenic temperature, the strength weight is actually similar to colon fiber. So so if you look at the mature properties at room temperature, it looks like the deal el is going to be twice as heavy. But if you look at the mature properties at cryogenic temperature of full hard steel stainless of particular grades, then you actually get to a similar strength weight as Caron pber. And in the case of starship, both the fuel and the oxidaser are cryogenic. So for falcon nine, the fuel is rocket propelled grade kerosene, basically pure, like A A very pure form of jet fuel, which is but is that is roughly room temperature. Although we do action, we actually chill it slightly below. We chill it like a bedeliwe do chill it, but but it's sarcryogenic. In fact, if we made it cryogenic, it would just turn to wax. So but for saship, it's liquid methane. And a look at auction, they there are liquid at similar temperatures. So basically almost the entire primary structure is a cryogenic temperature. So then you've got a 300 series stainless that's for this strahardened because it's at almost all things. The crygenic temperature actually has a similar strength to weight as carn fiber because 50 times less raw material and is very easy to work with. You can weld stainless steel outdoors. You could smoke cigar while welding stainless steel. It's just like it's very resilient. You can modify it easily. It's if you want if you want to attach something, you swelder right on. So very easy to work with, very low cost. And now, like I said, at cryogenic temperature, similar strength to weight to common n five ber. Then when you factor in that, that we don't need, don't we have a much reduced heat shield MaaS because the melting point of steel is much greater than the melting point of aluminum? It's about twice the melting point of aluminum. And so you can . just run the rocket bunch hotter. Yes. So especially for the show, which is coming in like a blazing meteor, it is you can greatly reduce the MaaS of the heat shield. So you can call it cut the MaaS of the windward part of the heat shield in maybe in half, and you don't need any heat shielding on on the leeward side. So the net result is actually the steel rocket weighs less than the carbon fiber rocket because the resin in the carbon fiber rocket starts to melt. Basically, cobfiber and alualuminum have about the same operating temperature capabilities. And whereas seal can operate at twice temperature, I mean, these are very rough fluxations tions. People, well, I won't get rocket. I'm it's like people say, Oh, he said it's twice. It's actually it's actually point eight, the shudow. So that's what the main common is going to be about. Damn, the point is actually, in retrospect, we should have started what done steel in the beginning. It was done mb, not to do steel. Okay. But to put this back to you, what I'm hearing is this steel was a riskier, less proven path other than the early us rockets versus carbon fiber was like a worse but more proven outpath. And so you need to be the one to push for, Hey, we're gonna to do this riskier path and just figure it out. And so you were fighting like a sort of conservatism in a sense. That's why I initially said that the issue is that we weren't making fast enough progress. We having trouble making even a small barrel section of the carbon fiber that didn't have wrinkles in it. So because at that large scale, you have to have many pliers, many sort of layers of the carbon fiber, you've got to cure it, and you've got to cure it in such way that it doesn't have any wrinkles or cure defects. The carbon fiber is much less resilient than steel. It has much, it's less toughness. So like stainless steel will scratch and bend. The con fiber will tend to shatter. So topghness being the area out of the stress strand curve, so that you're generally going to have to do better with steel. With stainless steel is, be precise, one of those starship question. So I visited star base. I was two years ago with Sam teller, and that was awesome. It very cool to see in a whole bunch of ways what they, I noticed was that people really took pride in the simplicity of things where, you know, everyone wants to tell you how starship is just a big soda can and you were hiring welders and you know, if you can weld in any industrial project, you can weld here. But there's a lot of pride in the simplicity and well. you starship is very complicated rocket. So that's what I'm getting at is are things simpler or are they complex? I think maybe just what they're trying to say is that you know you don't have to have like prior experience in the rocket industry to work on astarsha. But you know somebody just needs to be smart and work hard and be trustworthy and make can work in a rocket. They don't they don't need prior rocket experience. Starship is the most complicated machine ever made by humans. both ked by a long gshain. What regard ds anything really? Hathere isn't a more complex machine. Yeah. I mean, I'd say that there's there's pretty much any any project I can think of would be easier than this. And that's why no one has made a rapireuseful. Nobody has ever made every fully reuseful over the rocket. It's a very, very hot problem. I mean, many smart people have tried before, very smart people with immenresources than they failed. So and we haven't succeeded yet. You know, talking is partially reusable, but the up to stage is not starship version three. I think this design, that it can be fully reusand, that full reusability is what will enable us to become a multiplanet civilization. Can you say about the soils? So I don't like I said I any technical problem, even like a hydrlic later or something like that, it's easier. Following this, we spent a lot of time on bottlenecks. Can you say what the current starship bottlenecks are even at the high level? I mean, trying to make it not explode generally that all chestnut really wants to explode. All those combuster. We've had two boosters explode on the test on one obliterthe obliterate the entire test facility. So only takes that one mistake. And I mean, the amount of energy contained in the starship p is insane. And so that why it's harder than falcon. It's because of just more energy. It's a lot of new technology. It's pushing the performance envelope. The raptor three engine is very, very advanced entrance ine, by far the best rock tion ever made. But it desperately wants to blow up. I mean, just put this in perspective here on liftothe. The rocket is generating over 100 gigawatts of power, 20% of yours. Yes, sexactually insane. It's a great comparison. While not exploding, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes Yeah. So I was like, how does it not explode? There's there's a you know thousands of ways that it could explode and and only one way that that it doesn't. So we we want it to really Ely, not really not explode, but but fly reliably on a daily basis, like once an hour and obviously blows up a lot. It's very difficult to maintain that flush caings, yes. And then I'm gonna say like like what's the what's the single biggest remaining problem for starship? It's having the heat Shiel be reusable that such that the no no one has ever made. A reusable orbital heat shield. So the heat shields go to make it through the ascent phase without shocking a bunch of tiles, and then it's going to come back in and also not lose a bunch of tiles or overheat the main airframe. And then that . Harit's kind of fundamentally a consumable. Well, yes, but your brake pads in your car are also consumable, but that laa very long time. So it just needs to last very long time that that's just Yeah, trying to, I mean, we had brought the ship back and had to do a soft landing in the ocean. Done that a few times, but it lasts a lot of tiles. You know you know, it was not been usable without a lot of work. Yeah. So even though it land did come to soft landing, it would not have been reusable without a lot of work. And so it's not really reusable in that sense. That's the biggest problem that remains is fully reusable heat shield. Like you want to be able to land it refall propellant and flagame without. You can't do this laborious inspection of your 40000 tiles sort of thing. I'm curious how you drive like when when I read biographies of yours, it just. it seems like you're just . able to drive the sense of like urgency and drive the sense of like this is the, this is a thing that can scale. And I'm curious why you think other organizations of your like spacx and Tesla are really big companies now and you're still able to keep that culture. What goes wrong with other companies such that . they're not able to do that, I don't know. But like today you said you . had like a bunch of SpaceX meetings. Like what is it that you're doing there that's like keeping that that's adding urgency? Yeah, Yeah. Well, I don't know. I guess the urgency is going to come from where I was leading the company. So of my assessurgency, I would like monacal sense urgency so that monacal sense urgency projects through the rest of the company. Is it because of consequences? They're like if you know, Elon set a crazy deadline, but if I don't get it, I know what happens to me. Is it just you're able to identify bottlenecks and get rid of them so people can move fast? Like how do you how do you think about why your companies are able to move fast? Yeah. I'm constantly addressing the limiting factor. I mean, I mean, on the deadlines front, I mean, I generally actually tried to aim for a deadline that that I least think is at the fifth percentile. So it's not it's not like an impossible deadline, but it's the most aggressive deadline I can think of that could be achieved with 50 probability, which means that it will be late half the time and whatever. Like there is like a law of gaexpansion that applies to schedules like whatever given whatever schedule, like if you you said we're going to do this something in like five years, which to me is like infinity time, it will expand to fully available schedule and it will take five years. You know like there's like there's there's a physical limit like that. Like physics will limit how fast you can do certain things. Like so like scaling up manufacturing. There's like there's a rwish. You can move the atoms and scale manufacturing. That's why you can't like instantly make you know a million or something, million years a year or something. You've you've got to design manufacturing line. You could bring it up. You've got to ride the s curve of production. So Yeah, I guess like like what can I say? That's that's that's actually how people I think generally a maniful sense of urgency is very big deal. So and you want to have an aggressive schedule and you want to figure out what the limiting factor is at any point in time and help the team address that limiting factor. Can you maybe talk about the so starlink was z slowly in the works for many years. And Yeah. we talked about it all the way in . the beginning of the company. Yeah. And so then there was a team you had built in Redmond, and then at one point you decided this team is just not cutting out. But again, how did you like it went for a few years slowly. And so why did this? Why did you act earlier? And why did you act when you did? Like why was that the right moment of which to act? I mean, I have these very detailed engineering reviews weekly. That's maybe a very unusual level of granularity. I don't know anyone who runs a company or at least a manufacturing company that goes into level of detail at but I go into so it's not it's not as like I have a pretty good understanding of what's actually going on because we go we go through things in detail. And I'm a big believer we're in skip level meetings where the individuals, instead of having the person that reports to me say things, it's everyone that reports to them says something in in the technical review and they can't be advanced preparation. So otherwise you're going to get you know glazed, as I say these days, Yeah, exactly. Jz z money for advanced. You just like called them randomly. like, no, just go around the room. Everyone provides an update. So I mean, it's a lot of information keeping ahead because you've got to you've got them say, if you have meetings weekly or twice weekly, you've got a snapshot of what that person said and you can then plot the progress points, can sort of mentally plot the points on the curve and say, are we converging to a solution or not? Or or are we you know like I'll take drastic action only when I conclude that success is not in a set of possible outcomes. So when I say okay, when when I finally reached the conclusion that, okay, unless drastic action is done, we have no no chance of success, then I must have drastic action. And so that's that's I if that conclusion in 20018 took graaction . and fixed the problem, how many you know you've got many, many companies and in each of them, it sounds like you do this kind of deep engineering understanding of what the robottlenecks are so you can do these reviews with people. Yeah you've been able to scale it up to five, six, seven companies within one of these companies. You have many different mini companies within them. What determines the maximum here? Because you have like . 80 companies. 80? No, but you you have so many already. I'm like that's that's already remarkable. Why this current number? Yeah, exactly. I know. So we keep coming together. Like it depends on situation. So I actually don't don't have regular meetings with foreign companies so that the foreign company is sort of cruising along like look, basically, if something is working well and making good progress, then there's no point in me spending time on it. So I actually allocate time according to where where the where the limiting factor or the problem, where are things problematic or where are we pushing against like what is holding us back? You know I focus the risk of saying the words too many times, the limiting factor. So, so basically, if somethinglike the is, if something thinggoing really well, they don't see much of me. But if something thinggoing badly theysee a lot of me. So something or not even badly, it's like if someis a limiting factor, it's a learning factor. Exactly. It's not exactly very badly, but it's the thing. It's the thing that we need to make go faster or two. And so when someg's a limiting factor at SpaceX or Tesla, are you like talking weekly daily with the engineer that's working on it? How how does that actually work? Most things that the learning factor are weekly and some things are twice weekly. So the AI fichip reviews twice weekly. And so it's every Tuesday and Saturdays. Is the chip review. is it open ended and how long it goes? Technically, yes, but usually it's it's like two or three hours. I mean sometimes less. It's it depends on on how much they you're got to go through. Yeah, that's one thing. I'm I'm just trying to tease . out the the differences here because the outcomes seem quite different. And so I think it's interesting to know is what inputs are different. And it feels like the corporate world, one, like you're saying, just the CEO doing engineering reviews does not always happen despite the fact that that is that what the company is doing. But then time is often pretty finely sliced and half hour meetings or even 15 minute meetings and it seems like you hold more open enwe're talking about it until . we figure red out type meetings Yeah sometimes, but most slim team to more or less stay on time. So I mean, today's starship engineering review went a bit longer because there were more topics to discuss. Yeah trying to figure out how to scale 2 million plus tons to over per year . is quite challenging. Can I answer the question? So you said about optimus and AI that they're going to result in double diggrowth . rates within a matter of years. Oh, it the economy. Yeah, yes. Think that's right. What was the point of the doge cuts if the economy is going to grow so much? Well, I think like waste and food, not good things to have. You know I was actually pretty worried about, I guess, I mean, I think in the absence of AI and robotics, we're actually totally screwed because the national debt is pup like crazy. Now, our interest payments, the interest payments, the national debt exceed the military budget, which is a trillion dollars. So over a trillion dollars just in interest payments. You know, that was like, I was like, okay, pretty concerned about that. Maybe if I spend some time we can slow down the bankruptcy of the United States and give us enough time for the AI and robots to you know, help solve the national debt. Or we're not help solve, it's the only thing that could solve the national debt. Like we are 1000% going to go bankrupt as a country and fail as a country. Without AI and robots, nothing else will solve the national debt. And so so but welike to, well, we just need, we need enough time to get both the AI and robots to and not go bankrupt before then. I guess the thing I'm curious about is when note starts, you have this enormous ability to enact reform, and not that enormous, sure, sure. But totally by your point that like it's important that AI and robotics drive product improvements, drive GDP growth, but why not just directly go after the things you were pointing out, you know like the tariffs, uncertain components or whether it's like permitting? I'm like the president and very hard to cut to cut, to even even to cut things that are obvious waste and fraud, like like ridiculous waste and fraud. What I discovered that is it's extremely difficult even to cut very obvious waste and fraud from the government because the government has to operate on and like who's complaining? Like if if it. And if you cut off payments to fraud sters, they immediately come up with the most sympathetic sounding reasons to continue their payment. They don't say, please keep the fraud going. They say, no, like you're killing baby of hanandas. And we're like, meanwhile, there's no baby of handandas are dying. They're just making it up. The forces are capable of of coming with extremely compelling sort of heart wrenching stories that are false but nonetheless sound sympathetic. And that's what happened. And so it's like perhaps I should have known better. In fact, I thought, wait, let's take a let's try to cut some amount of waand forth from the government. Maybe there shouldn't be you know, 20 million people walked as alive in social security who are definitely dead. And over the age of 115, the oldest American is 114. So it's safe to say if somebody is 115 and Maris live in the social security database, something is there's either a typo like somebody should call them and say, we seem to have your birthday wrong or we need to mark you as dead. One of the two things intimidating called to get well. So it seems like a reasonable thing. And if like say, their birthday is in the future and they have you know as Small Business Administration loan and their birthday is 2165, we either again have a typo or we have fraud. So we say we otygotten the century of your birth. Incorrect or a great platform movie. Yes, this is this. this is when I when I in my ludicrous fraud, this when I'm met ludicrous fraud were those people getting payments, so some getting payments from social security. But but but the main fraud vector was to mock somebody as alive in social security and then use every other government payment system to basically to to do fraud because what those other government payment systems do would do what they will simply do. And are you a live check to the social security database? It's it's a bank shot. What would you estimate is like the total amount of fraud from the mechanism? My guess is, and and by the way, that the Government Accountability officers has done these eswords before. I'm not the only one is coming out is you know in fact, I think they they did the gao did analysis a rough estimate of fraud during the Biden administration and it calculated at roughly half a trillion dollars. So don't take my word for it. Take get a report issued during the Biden administration. This how about that from this social security mechanism. It's one of many it's important to appreciate that the government does not very ineffective at stopping for because it's not like like it was a company like stopping forward. You've got a motivation because it's affecting the earnings of your company, but the government just they just print more money. So it's not like you need you need caring and competence. And these are in short supply at the . federal level. Yeah, I sorry. I mean, when you go to the dmv, do you think, wow, this is a bastion of competence? Well, now imagine it's worse than the dmv, because it's the dmv that can print money. So was it nathese the state level dmbs need to the states more or less need to stay within their budget, go bankrupt, but the federal government just Press full money? Was it not possible if there's a cash, half a trillion of fraud, why was it not possible to cut all that? Because when essentially we did, we actually know you really have to stand back and recalibrate your expectations for competence because you're operating in a world where you you've got to sort of make ends meet. Like you know you've got to pay your bills. You've got to you know buy the microphones. Yeah, Yeah, exactly. So so you don't have it's not like this a giant, largely uncaring monster bureaucracy. It's not even and and a bunch monaccronistic computers that are just that are just sending payments. Like one of the things that the dose came to was. And it sounds so simple, that probably will save, let's say, 100 billion, maybe 200 billion a year, is simply requiring that payments from the main treasury computer, which is called pam, like payment accounts master or something like that, there's 5 trillion pms a year requiring that any that goes out have a payment appropriation code, make it mandatory, not optional, and that you have anything at all in the comment field because you see, you have to recalibrate how dumb things are. But you think paels were being sent out with no appropriation code. It's not checking back to any congressional appropriation and no explanation. And this is why the department of war formulated formative defense cannot PaaS an audit because the information is literally not there. Recalibrate your expectations. I wonder better understand this. Have a number because there's an ig . report in 20, 24. We was like. why is it so low? Maybe. But we found that like over seven years, the social security fraud they estimated was like 70 billion ons over seven years, like 10 billion years. So I'd be curious if you see what like the other four 90 billion is . federal government expendures a seven and a half trillion a year. Yeah. What percentage, how competent do you think of it is the discretionary spending there is like 15%? Yeah but doesn't matter. Most of the Ford is non discretionary. It's basically a fradulent Medicare, Medicaid, social security, you know, disability. There's a zilent government payments Yeah and a bunch of these payments are, in fact, they're block transfers to the states. So the federal government doesn't even have the information in a lot of cases to even see, know if this proad. Let's consider, let's like a reductiout of Sodom. The government the government is perfect and has no fraud. What is your probability estimate of that? Let mean know zero. Okay. So then would you say that foreign waste that the government is has is 90%? That also would be quite generous. But if it's only 90%, that means that there's $750 billion year of waste and fraud and it's not 90%. It's not 90% effective. This seems like a strange . rate of first prinphamount of fraud in the government. It's like how much do you think there is? And then anyways, we don't have to do a lot whatever. Be curious. Like so you know a lot about fraud at astroke pcontrying to do fraud. Yeah. But as you say, it's like a little bit of a we've really grounded down, but it's a little bit of a different problem space because you're . dealing with a much more heterogeneous set of fraud vectors here than we Yeah. But I mean, I mean, a tribe, you have high confidence ments and your trihard, you have high competence and high carbut. Still forward is nine zero now. Now imagine it's at a much bigger scale. There's much less confidence and much less Carry. You know, bank PayPal back in the day, we try to manage forward down to about 1% of the payment volume. And that was very difficult to transmof confidence tence in caring to get forward ud merely to 1%. Now imagine that that you're in an organization where there's much less caring and much less confidence tence. It's going to be much more than 1%. How do you feel now looking back on kind of politics and doing stuff there where it feels like from the outside in the you know two things have been quite impactful. Won the America paack and the acquisition of of well, Twitter at the time. But also it seems like there's was a bunch of heartache. And so what's your grading of the . whole experience? Well, I think those things needed to be done to maximize the probability that the future is good. So politics generally is very tribal, and it's very tribal. And people lose their objectivity usually with politics like they they generally have trouble seeing the good on the other side or the bad in their own side. That's generally how it goes. That, I guess, was one of the things that's surprised me the most is you often simply cannot reason with people if they're in one tribe or the other. They they simply believe that everything that tribe does is good and anything the other political tribe does is bad. And persuading them is otherwise it's almost impossible anyway. But I think overall, those actions, acquiring Twitter, getting trumelected, even though it makes a lot of people angry, I think I think those actions are good for we're good for civilization. But Yeah how does it feed into the future . you're excited about? Well, America needs to take, America needs to be strong enough to last long enough to extend life to other planets and to and get, I guess, AI and robotics to the point where we can ensure that the future is good. Like on the other hand, if we were to descend into, say, communism or some situation where the state was extremely oppressive, that would mean that we might not be able to become multiplanetary. Yeah, we might. The state might staff out our progress in AI robotics. How do you feel about. you know, optimus, groc et cec are going to be leveraged by and not just any revenue maximizing companies. Products will be leveraged by the government over time. How does this concern manifest in what private companies should be willing to give governments? What kinds of guardrails know should AI models be made . to do whatever the government . that has contracted them out to do, ask them to do? Should grog get to say, like actually even the military wants to do? X no, the grog will not do that. I probably the biggest danger of AI, well, maybe the biggest danger of faof for AI and robotics going wrong is government. Interesting, you know, I mean, the way you like by people who are opposed to corporations or worried about corporations should really worry about the most about government, because government is just a corporation in the limit. It's a government. It is, it is, it is. Government is just the biggest corporation with a monopoly on violence. So I always find it like a strange dichotomy where people would think corporations are bad, but the government is good, when the government is simply the biggest and worst corporation. But people have that dichotomy and somehow think at the same time the government can be good for corporations bad. And this is not corporations are have better morality than the government is this so I actually think it's you know, that's that that is a thing to be worried about is like if you know, should should if the the government should not like the government could potentially use AI on robotics to suppress the population. Click that as a source concern . as a guy building AI and robotics, how do you . how do you like, how do you prevent that? Well, I think if you have a limited government, if you limit the powers of government, which is like really what the us constitution is intended to do, it's intended to limit the powers of the government, then you're probably going to have a better outcome than if you have more government. So products . will be available to all government thread. not about all governments. It's difficult to predict the, but like I said, like what's the end dpoint, or like what is what is many years in the future, but it's difficult to predict this sort of path along along that way. Like if civilization progresses, AI will vastly exceed the semble of human intelligence and and there will be far more robots than humans along the way. What happens? It's very difficult to predict. I mean, it seems like one thing you would do, just say, you are not allowed to whatever government x, you're not allowed to use optimus to do x yz, just write out like a policy. I mean, I think you treated recently that rock should have a moral constitution. And one of those things could be that we limit what governments are allowed to do with this advanced technology. I mean, Yeah we can do what is what I mean, particularly ingly. I mean, if the politions PaaS a law and they can enforce that law, then it's hard to not do that law. The best thing we can have is limited government where you have the appropriate cost checks between the executive, judicial and legislative branches. I guess the the reason I'm curious about it is this. Like at some point, it seems like the limits will come from you, right? Like you've got the optimisyou've got the spaceship . you is you've got that . I think I be the boss of the government or you will get you will like the I mean, already it's the case with SpaceX that for things that are crucial to the, like the government really cares about getting certain satellites up in space, whatever. Like it needs SpaceX. It is the, it is the unnecessary contractor and you are in the process of building more and more of the technological components of the future that will have an analogous role in different industries. And you could have this ability to like set some policy that is suppressing classical liberalism in any way. My companies will not help in any way with that or you know some policy like that. I'll do my best to ensure that anything that's within my control maximizes the good outcome for humanity. I think anything else would be short sighted because I was sound part of humanity. So I like you ans pro viepro you mentioned that dojo three will be used for . space based compute. You really read my . what I say? I don't know if you know Twitter but I know you laughlot of followers. They get worry. How do how you discerned my secrets. I bought some how do you design . a chip for space? What we're like? Yeah what changes? Well. I guess you want to design to be more radiation tolerant and run at a higher temperature. So you get Yeah roughly, if you increase the operating temperature by 20% in degrees calelvin, you can cut your radiator MaaS in half. So running at a higher temperature is helpful in space. There's I mean, there's various rest things you can do for shielding the memory. And but like neural nets are going to be very resilient to bed flips. So like most of what happens for radiation is like random liflips. But like if you've got like you know a multi trillion parameter model and you get a few blood flips, doesn't matter. It's one like heuristic programs are going to be much more sensitive to butflips than some giant parameter file. So I just decided to run hot. And I think you pretty much do the same way that you do things on earth, part from make it run water. I mean, the solar arrays, most of the weight on the satellite. Is there a way to make the the GPU's even more power dends than what nvidia and tpu's and ettera are planning on doing? That would, you know, be especially privilege in the . space based world? Well, I mean, the basic math is like if you can do about a kilowatt periratical and then youneed, you know 100 million full radical trips to do 100 gigawatts. So depending what your yield assumptions are, you know that tells you how many trips you need to make. But cool, you need if if you're going to have 100 gigawatts power, you need you know 100 million chips running that are running at kilowatt sustained up quite perietical 100. Basic month, 100 million ships depends on Yeah if you look at the die size of something like black lgps or something and how many you can get out of a wafer, you can get like on the order of dozens or less per wafer. So you're basically, you're, this is a world where if we're putting that out every single year, you're producing millions millions of wafers a month. That's the plan with tariff. Have millions away for a month of advanced process notes. Could be some number north of a million. I think you're got to do the memory too. Now you're going to make a memory fab. I think the tfagot to do memory. It's got to do logic. memory and package. I'm very curious how somebody like gets started. This is like the most complicated thing man has ever made. And obviously, like if anyis up to the task, you're up to the task. Like what do you so you realize as a bottleneck and you go to your engineers and like, what is the next? Like, what what do you tell them to do? I want a million waa month in 2030. What is the next? Like, what do you, that's right. Do you like call sml? Like what is this exactly what I want. What is the next? That so much to ask. Well, we make a little fab and see what happens. Make our mistakes at a small scale and then make a big one is a little fab down now as I've done which I mean we're not gonna to keep that cat that chance gonna to come out of the back room itbe like drones hovering over the bloody thing. You know you'll be able to like see its construction progress on x right you know in real time. So no, I mean, like I don't know, we could just flounder and fail ure to fear. It's like not success is not guaranteed but since we want to try to make you know something like 100 million Yeah we we need well we want 100 gigawatts of power and 100 100 that troops that can take 100 gigawatts right so call it Yeah know but Yeah by 2030 so then it will take as many chips as our suppyers will give us. I've this I've actually said this to tsmc and Samsung and micris like please build ld your more faabs faster and we will guarantee you to buy the output of those fabs so that they're already like moving as fast as they can. Like it's it's not like to be clear, not like us, you know it's not like either. It's not like it's us plus them. You know there's an evidence . dent that the people doing AI want a very large number of you know chips as quickly as possible and then many of the input suppliers, the fab, but also you know the turbine manufacturers, are not ramping up production very quickly. No. And the exyeah, the explanation you hear is . that they're . dispositionally conservative. You know they're Taiwanese or German as the you know, story maybe. And they just like don't believe. They say, like, is that really the explanation or is there's something else? Well, I mean, it's the reason like if somebody dy's been in, say, the computer memory business for 30 or 40 years and they've seen cycles, they've seen like women bust like ten times. Yeah, you know so so like that's a lot of layers of scar tissue, you know? So it's like it's like during the boom times, looks like everything is gonna be great forever. And then then then the crash happens, and then like desperately trying to avoid bankruptcy, and and then there's another boom and then another crash. Are there are there . are there other ideas you think others should go pursue that you're not for whatever . reasons right now? I mean, there are a few companies that are there are pursuing like new ways of doing chops, but there's just not scaling tests I mean. within AI. I mean, just generally. I'd say like people should just should do the thing that where they find that they're highly motivated to do that thing as opposed to you know sumsumming of some idea that I suggest they should do the thing that they find personally interesting and motivating to do. But you know going back to the limiting facof, use that phrase about 100 times the the current limiting factor that I see in the time frame, you know in the sort of 20, 29, 20, like in a 33 to four year time frame, it's chips. In the one year time frame, it's it's energy power production, electricity, like it's not clear to me that there's enough but use electricity to turn on all the air shifts that are being made towards the end of this year. I think people are going have real trouble turning on like the chip output will exceed the ability to turn chips on. What's your plan to deal with that world? Well, we're trying to accelerate electricity production. I guess that's maybe one of the reasons that xai will be maybe the leader, hopefully the leader his that we'll be able to turn on more chifts than other people can turn on faster because we're we're good at hardware and and generally, the innovations from the corporations that that call themselves labs, the ideas tend to flow. Like it's rare to see that there's like more than about a six month difference between like the ideas traveled back and forth with the people. So I think you sort of hit the hardware wall and and then whichever company can scale hardware the fastest will be the leader. And so I think xci will be able to scale hardware the fastest and therefore most likely will be the leader. You you jokes are you know we're self conscious about se you know using the the limiting factor phthese again, but I actually think there's something deep here. And if you look at a lot of things we've touched on over the course of it, maybe kind of a good note to end on. Like if you think of a senescent lower agency company, it would have some bottleneck and not really be doing anything about us. You know, mark and Dreeson had the line of most people are willing to endure any amount of chronic pain to avoid acute pain. And it feels like a lot of the cases we're talking about are just leaning into the acute pain, whatever it is. It's like, okay, we got to figure out how to you know work with steel, or we got to figure out how to run the chips in space, or like we'll take some near term acute pain to actually solve the bottleneck. And so that's kind of a unifying thing. Have a high pain threshold. That's helpful. Solve the button ttlenecyes. So you know one thing I can say is like I think the future is going to be very interesting. As I said, the Davos only been especially dawas link was on the ground for like three hours or something. It's better to be it's better to err on the side of optimism and be wrong than err on the side of pessimism and be right for quality of life. So you know your happiness will be you'll be happier if you are on the side of optimism rather than early on the side of pessimism. And so I recommend earring on the sadle afterwards stle as to that. Cool you. Thanks for doing this. Thank you for great stamina. Hopefully this encounters the pain and the pain int tolerance. Hey everybody, I hope you enjoyed that episode.
