In the 30 person organization, you see an opportunity and you just do it. Almost every large organization has a bureaucracy problem, but a lot of times things just don't happen because it's it there's just too much overhead. It's not that the organization is healthy and then it gets a virus. Is actually the composition of the organization is what's creating bureaucracy. I'm here with Bill Anderson. You've never heard of him, but you're about to understand why he's one of the most fascinating CEOs operating today. Bill runs Bayer. It's a company that's been around since 1863. They invented aspirin. This is a 160year-old pharmaceutical and agricultural giant. When Bill joined, it had a 100,000 employees spread all over the globe. By every measure, it should be the poster child for corporate bureaucracy. Here's what makes Bill interesting. Since taking over as CEO 2 years ago, he's essentially torn down and rebuilt how the entire company operates. He's flattened 11 layers of management, expanded some managers direct reports from 60 to 90, and thrown out the entire budgeting and planning process. This episode's not just theory. This is a realworld case study of how to scale without becoming sclerotic, how to stay agile even at massive size, and frankly, how to avoid the bureaucratic death spiral that kills most growing companies. You'll learn why bureaucracy doesn't infect organizations, it comes from within. Why the key to staying nimble as you scale is the kind of people you hire. And why the key to earning trust as a leader is admitting when you don't know what the hell you're doing. Before you think, well, it's easy to build the organization you want at a huge company with unlimited resources. Remember, Bill's doing this while navigating patent cliffs, regulatory challenges, and shareholders looking for him to turn the stock around. If you're a founder going from a 100 to a,000 employees, if you're trying to maintain startup energy as you scale, or if you're just frustrated by the speed of your organization, this is a conversation for you. Bill's basically created a playbook for organizational transformation I wish I'd had when we were building HubSpot. Bill, amazing to have you, my friend. One of the things I've noticed these days is the rule book for being a CEO and the best practices seems to be getting rethought. Man, you're the perfect guest because from inside a company that's over 160 years old with 100,000 employees. You seem to be rethinking how to run a company. And so, thanks for coming on. Really appreciate it. Yeah, thanks for the invitation, Brian. Glad to be here. Tell me a little bit what's broken. You know, what what do CEOs have wrong? What are companies doing wrong? what you know what what's the problem? Why did you have to attack this? Many companies have their own very specific problems, but almost every large organization has a bureaucracy problem. And uh it's really interesting because this is something that I've been trying to get my head around for yeah probably at least two decades. And I say that because I think I I became a manager first about 25 years ago. And um and I noticed, you know, when I was a new manager that one of the things that we managers were doing was we were we were trying to fight bureaucracy. We were busting bureaucracy. We're trying to take out complications, simplify, prioritize. Um and so that was, you know, 1999. And then, you know, like fast forward to, oh, 15 years later and I noticed, wow, you know, we're we're we're still doing that. Yeah. Only the thing I noticed is is like we're doing all this bureaucracy busting, but things are only getting worse. You're kind of like, hm, what's going on here? You know, it's kind of like if imagine you had a disease and the more you tried to treat the disease, the worse it got. you you kind of have to rethink your strategy. So I I think that's kind of a starting point. I I find with HubSpot like the bigger we got, the less we got done. Do you feel the same way? Yeah. Yeah. Um that's that's I I had the same kind of thing because I went from a 30 person enterprise to a 700 person enterprise and then that 700 person enterprise merged with another and we became 5,000. Then I went to like a 10,000 person organization. and then a 100,000 person organization. I noticed that. Yeah. It it the bigger you got, the worse it got. Yeah. Like for example, in the 30 person organization, you'd see an opportunity and you just do it. Or you see an opportunity and you need some help. So you call a couple of your friends and at at lunch because you're just eating around the same table. You got only got a little table, you know, in your in your like little break room. And uh you just go, "Hey, what what if we do this?" and before lunch is over, you've decided, "Yeah, we're gonna do this." And you and you do it. And then and then I go to like from a 700 person organization to a 5,000 person organization, that same activity. Oh, you you can't just talk to two people. you got to talk to like seven people and then they got to talk to their managers and then you got to have like a follow-up meeting and you know maybe occasionally you actually get something done but a lot of times things just don't happen because it's it there's just too much overhead. Okay. So t talk about is bare is a lot of people you joined and you made massive changes. I read somewhere that you eliminated 11 layers of management. you took the rule book from 3,000 pages to I figured like you really have kind of torn it down and are rebuilding it. What are some of the what are you up to? Maybe before I answer that, let me just just complete sort of the analogy. The there's a common thought among managers that bureaucracy is is kind of like a virus that infects the the healthy organization or the healthy healthy organism and then you got to kind of take the virus out. Yeah. And I would argue that's actually the wrong way to think about it. The the truth is that it's not that the organization is healthy and then it gets a virus. Is actually the composition of the organization is what's creating bureaucracy. Yeah. You know, like think about it. Nobody gets up in the morning and says some manager in a in a big multinational company gets up in the morning and says, "Hey, I'm going to go be a bureaucrat." Like nobody thinks like that. It's it's and so um so I mention that because it's it's actually the presence of 10 or 12 layers. It's the fact that things are organized by this kind of functional org chart instead of being organized around the customer around the product. Right? It's th those are the things those layers the the need for signoffs the the fact that people four layers removed from the product or the customer are actually decision gatekeepers. Y that is what is bureaucracy. It so it's you can't you can't actually just take out the bureaucracy. You you have to take out the parts of the system that make the bureaucracy. So, what we've done at Bayer, we um when I arrived, we had 11 to 12 layers and now we have six to seven. Okay. Now, you might think, well, six to seven, that's still a lot of layers. But if you consider that, not that many for 100,000 person or it's not. Yeah, exactly. It it it goes really fast when you're counting them, you know? It's like specifically for you, how many direct reports do you have? Um I have actually I don't know how many I have. Maybe 14 or something. Okay, 12. Um, so what we've done is we've we've taken out the layers. By the way, lots of people talk about taking out layers. In fact, pretty much every reorg someone some says, "Oh, we got to take out layers." Um, usually that's missing the point. If you have a 12 layer organization and you take out two layers, which is probably the the average big corporate reorg, they'd be lucky to take out two layers. That does nothing. If if the basic way things are done, decisions are made up and down the hierarchal functions. Uh you have annual budgets where the money is divided into thousands of little cost centers and those are kind of like the money's trapped. They're like money traps, right? Um if that's how you're operating your business, it it's not going to get meaningfully better. You can make it for example yeah it's better to have 10 layers than 12 but the same basic problems are going to persist and so what we've done is we've taken out we've taken out so many layers and we've expanded people's span of we we don't call it span of control we call it span of coaching we do that not because it's a clever name but because we have lots of people in our organization Well, let let me give you the facts first and then I'll give you examples. So, our average span of control was 6 and a half, which isn't actually that bad. A lot of large companies, it might be five. We're now at 14, and it's still going up. We're not done. And if you look into that, what you find is we have all kinds of people with with 20 direct reports, 30 direct reports. The most I know of, we have some people with 90 direct reports. The reason I mention that is not to be obsessed with the math. Think about this. Let's say you're managing five people, you know, and you've got your drill like, okay, you have annual performance plans and goals and they're going to review them with the manager and you're you're hiring and firing and you're managing performance issues and all that stuff. Okay? You're managing that. You're doing that for five people. Now, you come into work the next day and the boss says, "Hey, you know what? You're gonna manage 90 people instead of five. You think your work's gonna change? If you're doing one-on- ones, your your schedule's done. Yeah. I mean, think about it. How many one-on- ones could you do? So, right. You you're not doing one-on- ones. You're not you're not doing the same job. It's a different job. So, instead of the idea that the management is directing the activity of the organization, that's done. Command and control, forget about it. you you can't command and control an organization that's that flat. You you have to switch to a mindset that hey the the people of the organization are owning the business. They are whether they're engineers or aronomists or doctors or lawyers or what whatever their job is salespeople they actually they and their colleagues their their peers are owning the business. And the job of people in management is simply to uh kind of like be greasing the skids, you know, to be figuring out, hey, where's there a bottleneck? Where where's the where's, you know, where where are things stuck? And so we actually we have a yeah, we have a a description for that model. But but that's the idea. So that's what we're doing. We're we're getting rid of annual budgets. Everything is on 90 90-day cycles. the whole organization including the leadership team and every 90 days groups of people come together and say hm what are we going to do the next 90 days what are the most important things and then we spend one day every 90 days planning so evaluating what happened the last 90 days what are we going to do the next 90 days can we do it with fewer people if you know if a couple people from our team we don't need anymore they're going to go join another team right so this is happening every 90 days 10 or 15% of the organization is moving to a different team um teams are collapsing like teams go away and new teams are formed so you know again you have some standing teams like let's say there's some molecule you're going to launch in five years time well the the product development team is not going away in 90 days un unless you unless you fail in in trials or something So you have some teams that are durable teams and you have other teams that are that form for 90 days, 180 days and then they go away. So that's what we're doing at Bear. Okay. So I had a lot of questions on that. Um h you know at some level you have priorities like you're trying to get some stuff done. You're trying to drive some results. you've in your head you have priorities like how do you come up with the priorities and how do you roll them down to what seems more like a jazz band than an orchestra. Yeah. Yeah. Well, here's the thing. An orchestra there's a there's a score. Mhm. Businesses don't have a score unless you're just doing the same thing over and over again. They have an earnings call. Yeah. But that's not a score. Mhm. That's where the earnings call is where you got to go and present your results. Yeah. The the investors don't care how you got it. They want to know what you delivered. Yeah. And and so yeah, business is a lot more like jazz than it is like, you know, Beethoven. And I think most businesses are more like Beethoven than And the bigger they are, the more likely are they are like Beethoven than they are a startup is more like a jazz man in my mind. But think about that, you know. So, so is that good? Not necessarily. Definitely not necessarily. Um, but it seems like gravity as organizations get bigger, they they they look more and more like orchestras. They're more structured. There's more layers. The planning is longer. The budgeting is much stricter. And so, you seem to have broken all that down. And I spent a lot of time build just like coaching. I basically coach startup founders and try to teach them how to be scaleup CEOs. Like how do they make that move from startup founder to scaleup CEO without turning into an orchestra, without turning into, you know, a sclerotic slow, you know, how do they avoid it from the g from the get-go? Well, they usually don't. Yep. Um, and if you look at the big tech companies, yeah, what I can tell from people I know who've worked in them or working in them now as an example, most of most of them are big bureaucracies now, big command and control. They have all the normal corporate mechanisms. Yeah. And now I want to be clear about something and this is this is a bit of a headscratcher for a lot of people. You can do worse than having a hierarchical bureaucracy. In fact, a well-run hierarchical bureaucracy can deliver okay performance. And the the way I think about it, and I use this analogy a lot, it's kind of like there's hierarchy hill and hierarchy hill think about it this way. Let's say you've got two 10,000 person organizations. Each of them has the top hundred people that are basically calling the shots. Y and the other 99,900 people are more or less order takers. Okay. Which means they're not that motivated. They're not they're not killing themselves to deliver new innovation or because it's too hard. Yeah. Because if they have to work their way up through eight layers to get anything done, it's exhausting. They Yeah. They know, hey, that's not really what's being expected of me. They just expect me to, you know, comply. All right. Now, if you have two of these organizations, one of them, let's say the CEO and the executive team are more concerned about improving their golf handicap, and the other one, the CEO and the executive team are totally into the customers, the products, the technology. They're they're really into it. Well, which one of those do you think is gonna perform better? Yeah. Right. And and by the way, this that latter one I like to call it the missionaries versus the mercenaries. Yeah. So like say more how do you describe those? I kind of like when I think of HubSpot in the early days um like you think of the first 10 employees like the reason the first 10 employees joined HubSpot is very different than the hundredth to the 110th versus the thousandth to the thousandth to the etc etc. value prop we we espouse and so everyone sort of joined because they they love the mission or they like their colleagues they didn't play golf uh they were completely focused on probably worked 100 hours a week and just naturally and by the way I think this is okay and natural you should put off in my mind sorry put off as long as possible but there's a natural progression where the reason someone joins a 10,000 employee company is very different than a 10 person and you're going to have people who are more mercenaries who have a life thank goodness and have different priorities. So, it changes over time. And I guess what I'm curious about you guys is like it's a 100,000 flocking people. That's a lot. How many do you actually have that you think are the missionary types? Look, you know this, Brian, there's there's a hundred or a thousand ways to kind of simplify the world, categorize, etc. I mean, I don't I don't really work with the missionary um missionary uh uh mercenary model so much because what I find is that almost everyone is capable of being of having kind of missionary zeal about something. Love that. You know, I I I have um uh a brother-in-law who who was a cop and um and you know, but he was really into what he did in in you know, in his job, but he because of the nature of the being a be being a policeman, he had a lot of free time. and in his free time where he wasn't, you know, he wasn't fighting city hall literally, you know, he he was, you know, he was building amazing things. He was organizing um uh trips for people from his church to rebuild houses that got destroyed by tornadoes. And he would organize the whole thing, man. They they would show up and like rebuild a house in two weeks. Yeah. You know, like a team of 15. So he he was he was missionary in his spare time and he was an employee in his job. And the way I look at it is every every bear person can be allin on the bear mission. And the question is are we going to create the environment that makes that normal? Yeah. or would you have to be kind of weird to actually do that because you're you're always fighting city hall? Yeah. Okay. So, let's just say I'm a founder. I'm 100% company. It's scaling. It's very flat. I've interviewed everyone and I'm going from a 100 to a thousand. So, I work with tons of tons of CEOs in this spot. How do I avoid the oification? How do I avoid the orchestra? How do I avoid the mercenary? whatever you want to call it. What advice do you have for me as as that I'm on a rocket ship. I'm CEO of a rocket ship. 100 employees going to a thousand. Don't hire professional managers. Huh. But my venture capitalists, the first thing they say when I raise my series B is, "You need to uple uplevel your team." What do I say when they say that, Bill? Look at Look at um Not kidding, by the way. Look at look at a company like Amazon. They did not hire professional managers. They they had the same people who were there when there was five people when there was a 500 and 5,000 and 50,000. you know, they because they correctly intuited that if they went and hired professional managers, they end would end up with a dull, mediocre organization. And again, by the way, it's not the manager's fault. This is this is this. It's a system. It's a way of organizing. and and if you hire but if you hire managers who've been trained that that is what good looks like that's what they're going to implement. Okay. Now now you may need to uplevel like for example you might have a a a person who's the finance person who who was capable of of leading in a 10erson organization who's not capable of of leading in a thousand person organization. Y but that doesn't mean the answer is to hire a professional manager as your CFO. It means you got to find a better CFO who is dynamic and isn't thinking like a bureaucrat. And and you may say, well, where do you find those people? Yeah, okay. It gets a little, you know, that's a longer conversation. Yep. Bill, both of us are while we're on this, both of us are MBAs. We went to Sloan School in Silicon Valley. you dependency is it's like people aren't that psyched about MBAs like they used to be if they ever were. What's your take on that? Like you're interviewing somebody for, you know, one of these more entrepreneurial CFO jobs or whatever it would be. Are you allergic to NBAs or you like them? Actually, I'm I'm pretty um I love education and I love people who are lifelong learners. I don't I don't spend a lot of time looking at whether or not someone has an MBA or not. In fact, the the the executive leadership team at Bayer is six people total, including me. And honestly, I couldn't even tell you if anybody I know I have an MBA. I I honestly couldn't even tell you if any of the other ones have an MBA or not. They pro probably a couple of them do, but I didn't even notice. Um it's it's now of course part of that is like when you're hiring somebody who's when you're at a lower level and you're hiring someone who's 25 you might think about it differently than when you're hiring people you know later in career. Okay. So vice vice number one got that avoid that advice let me let me just kind of go through things that CEOs ask me about like you're 100 employees it's pretty chaotic uh you're growing fast and like budgeting is chaotic planning is chaotic. Okay, the venture capitalist says, "Let's put an annual budgeting cycle in. Let's meet our budgets. Uh, let's plan the year very carefully." And you plan it, let's say, in September for the next year to start January. And then by the time July rolls around, the whole world has freaking changed. What advice do you have to that CEO who's trying to scale and is dealing with a lot of chaos right now? Yeah. So, this is classic. So the way a a complex organization, a bureaucratic organization handles that situation, like okay, we we got to have financial discipline, the way they handle that is we got to we got to pin down where every dollar is going to go in advance. Yeah. You know, it's a it's kind of logical, but it doesn't work. In other words, okay, if it's November now, I got to figure out how all where all the money is going to go. Yep. In the next 12 months. um kind of down to the department, the activity, you know, etc. And and we think when we're doing that that we're actually somehow creating value because like we've specified it, but as you said, the whole world changes. And by the way, that that's true in startups, but it's it's pretty true in big multinationals, too. Yeah. Yeah. And and so what we do now is we we we we call it a two-tier resource allocation approach. We we call it dynamic resource flow. So tier one would be like your agreement with the venture capitalists. Okay. Tier one would be hey we're going to spend $2 million in the next 12 months and or whatever it is $20 million in the next 12 months and we're going to deliver the at a high level. these are the big things we're going to deliver while we're doing that. Okay, that's tier one and that's where the kind of nailing it down because hey, we've committed to our investors or we've committed, you know, like so that you can't really give on. But that's okay because it's it's high level. It's it's like now at tier two you don't do you so so the normal corporate thing is you take that that let's say it's 20 million and you divide it up into a h 100,000 here and 500,000 there and you assign those numbers to individuals and you tell them you're accountable for this you're accountable for this and then they all are incented basically to spend whatever that number is not more not less okay but of course that's stupid because the world's changing and you don't want that money divided up that way because in by July that doesn't make sense anymore. Yeah. So So instead of doing that, you you go with your 20 million number. That's tier one. And tier two, you've got a resource pool. It's got 20 million in it. You've got leaders. Maybe maybe you're you're um you've got, I don't know, five program teams and an administrative team. And the five program teams are each working on some, you know, product they're developing. And then you've got a administrative team. They're responsible for keeping the lights on and whatever. Okay, you're having a conversation, a regular conversation about, okay, when we took the 20 million and we roughly assigned it across those six teams, but there's nothing special about that assignment. It's not the it's not the basis for your end ofear bonus. It's not it's not like, oh, if you spend less, you're you're great. And if you spend more, you're a dog or whatever. It's it's just a starting point because we're on January 1st. This is sort of where we are right now. So now everybody go work for 90 days. Do your best to drive your product forward to thrill your your prospects and to treat the company's money like it's your own money. And then we're going to come back after 90 days and just sort of check in. Okay? Oh, and team A says, "Actually, you know, we've hit a roadblock and we're we're kind of stuck." So, you say, "Oh, team A, you're stuck. Let's I tell you what, you're you're waiting for feedback from a regulator. It's going to take six months. So, we're going to take all the people from team A and and put them on the other teams. And um we're going to take all the money that was in team A. We're going to spread that over to the other teams. Okay, let's talk about team B. Ah, team B, we're we've got a new opportunity. We can actually do more. So, okay, good. Let's take some of those team A people, right? And and even more than that, you're you're doing this in a way that it's actually the teams that are sorting this out. It's not like the boss is deciding all this. Okay? So, that's and and and at the end of the year, nobody's a hero because they're the their allocation at the beginning of the year was 5 million and they only spent four. No, no. We'll talk about we'll talk about your performance at the end of the year in a peer review session. Okay, let's get into it. So, tip number one, careful of hiring professional managers. Tip number two is this different type of budgeting that's is a high level one, but it it sort of the midlevel. It's 90-day cycles, not um yearly cycles. Let's talk about it's 90-day cycles and it's not the basis for performance management. See, that's where a lot of a lot of bureaucracy gets created by by each team thinking, "Oh, it's my job to spend this much, not more, not less." You're kind of locking it in where you say, "No, that that's just that's kind of funds available, but you should try to spend less if you can and and make more progress if you can, right?" And we'll talk about how you did later. Okay. So, I I'm I'm Joe Smith. I'm a frontline manager, coach, just I'm the CEO and I'm trying to design the organization like how do performance reviews work? If you're a 100 person company, you don't want all this this complexity creep in. How do how does the work chart work and how do performance reviews work? And Brian, a little caveat, okay? I mean, I don't think 100 person companies are that much of an intellectual challenge from a an organization model standpoint. In general, if you got a bureaucratic 100 person organization, then man, I don't know, something's wrong. Fine. But by a thousand people, it creeps in. Yeah. Thousand people, different story. Okay. So, you're at a 100, you want to go to a thousand. You don't want to be sclerotic. Yeah. Yeah. Here here's a here's a departure. Usually, if you're going from a hundred to a thousand, and I've been on that journey, that's where that is generally where you start bringing in the professional managers. It's it's usually more in the like 500 going to a couple thousand. You can kind of get away with the really informal stuff. I don't know, up to 300, 500, but then it starts to big decision you have to make is are you going to make managers responsible for performance management? Okay. or are you gonna draw on the power of the of the of of all the peers and the doers? Okay. And when you make that decision, you are sort of deciding the fate of whether this is going to continue to feel like a startup or whether it's going to be really take a a major fork in the road towards a hierarchical organization. Got it. Okay. So, the performance review comes around every 90 days, 180, how often? And then who who decides if I'm going to get a 2% raise or a 10% raise? I I'll give you a model for it. It's not the only one, but think about it this way. Uh we're working our way to a thousand people. Yeah. You're probably going to have you're probably going to find that you need, I don't know, 15, 20, maybe 30, even 40 managers. If you had 40 managers, they'd have 25 direct reports on average. Okay. So, you're somewhere in this range of like 25 to 50 direct reports per manager. If you're in that range, then you're first off, the managers, they're not reviewing and approving everything. You're hiring smart people. These smart people, they they they worked hard to get to your company, you know? Uh they don't need to be told what to do and babysat. They're going to have they're going to be all on teams. Yeah. And they will uh every 90 days they're going to get feedback from their peers. Whoever they worked with the most they're going to get feedback and it's a simple feedback system. They got a one that means great job. Yeah. Love working with you, you know, great impact. Uh two is wow, this person's really off the charts. like they are they're clearly performing above what anybody would ever normally expect. Yeah. And a zero is like hey uh needs improvement. Not good enough. Yeah. Needs to be better. Okay. And and then you get they're answering two questions. One question question is what was this person's major impact in the last 90 days and what could they have done to be even better? Yeah. Two questions. Every 90 days, everyone in the organization is getting th those questions answered from all their peers. And it turns out people actually care a lot more what their peers think than they think what what their boss thinks. Okay. How about the cashola? Yeah. How do you describe the cashish? How about the cashish? Yeah. Here's a learning. Here's a learning. And I've I've um I've heard this from a number of people who've been down this path and I've come to believe it through my experience and and the experiments that I've run. What you don't do is you don't take that rating that I just described. You get at the end of the year and let's say you've got 40 numbers, right? Because you you've done it every 90 days and you've worked with let's say 10 people each 90 days. So you let's say you got a um this one person's got a 1.2 two and somebody else has got a 1.3 and somebody else has got a 0.9. That doesn't become their multiplier. Okay. For their bonus because if you do that, you sort of weaponize the peer feedback system. Yeah. Of course. Yes. Then people they feel like I give you a one if you give me a one, right? Of course. Yeah. or or or like I can't just rate the person as I believe I should rate them cuz I'm thinking, "Oh, I think they really need the money or something." You know, it's just you don't want to do that. And by the way, people are It's really funny. I do I often do this in large groups. I'll ask people. I say, "Who do you think has a a better more objective view of your impact, your boss or your peers?" You know, and I ask like, "Okay, who says boss? Who says Pierce? Right. It'll be like It'll be like 98 of a 98 out of 100 people will say Pierce. Yeah. Then I say, "Who do you think should do your performance evaluation? Your boss or your peers?" Boss. Pierce. Okay. This is this is um we're we're working with humans. Humans are not logic machines. No. you know, and and so we're so we're implementing this now at Bayer worldwide. We're at 90,000 right now. Uh when I started, we had a little over 100,000. We're at 90,000. By the way, most of the positions we've eliminated, the vast majority were management management positions. What we're saying, we're we're implementing this peer peer uh um uh assessment, pure feedback. Okay? And we're telling people, hey, everybody breathe deeply, right? We have great people. This is we we want to learn from our peers because our peers know us better than our managers do. And and if if one of the major goals of the people of Bayer is to grow and to get better as a result of being a part of this team, then we owe it to each other to give each other this feedback. Yeah. We're going to put a we're going to put a hard break between the peer feedback and the comp. And it doesn't mean that it's irrelevant. So if I'm a manager of 50 people at the end of the year, I have what my eyeballs have witnessed over the year. I have the this feedback from you know and I have the the the qualitative and the quantitative. I have all that. Um I yeah I can see what teams have delivered. I have a variety of sources of information and based on that I got to make some decisions about as the manager. Okay. So the manager decides at the end of the fine. Yep. Fine. Okay. Got it. Okay. Titles. So, um, you know, a lot of Silicon Valley startups these days are like, "We're not doing titles." What's your reaction? I actually don't even really care. I I can't Well, your employees care. Yeah. You know, I we we first off, it's funny. We haven't we haven't tackled this in earnest. It's funny. It hasn't been a big topic. It doesn't mean that nobody cares about titles, but I think we we sort of say, hey, um, if you if you need a certain title to get your job done, then, you know, like let's talk to your manager about it and, you know, talk this isn't a conventional wisdom you're blowing up. No, because you know, titles are are one of those things where you can go around in circles. Y and at the end of the day, if your goal is to advance science and to do great things for customers, spending a lot of time talking about titles is not doing either of those things. That's great. Coming from you, you're the CEO, you have a good title, but like you're a middle manager. So, I'll tell you my experience with this. I tried to get rid of titles at HubSpot, probably around 50 employees. I was like, it's ridiculous. We spend so much damn time talking about this title. It adds no value to our customers. And I got rid of them. And then I was lobbied hard on this the titles thing. And the thing that kind of got me was I'm I'm not going to say let's say Frank Smith went home. He was going home for Thanksgiving and he was a he was a manager before and now he was a nothing and he's like I know I'm going to see my uncle Joe and my uncle Joe's be like okay did you get promoted? Are you a director now? And he's like no I didn't get promoted. I'm a nothing now. And by the way I'm a sales man. I used to be a sales manager. Now, when I call on people, they don't know where I am in the hierarchy. And and like Napoleon used to say, it's amazing what a soldier will do for another color ribbon on their shoulder. And so, I got kind of I got worn down on it and I brought titles back, but but anyway, it doesn't sound like this is one of your your trust busting ideas around CEOing. Yeah, it's not. So, so in other words, I'm not I'm not trying to get rid of titles. It's just not It's kind of like the org chart. We've done this with the org chart, too. In our model, we still have an org chart. We just put it I always say we put it at the back of the room. It It's just It's like it's not that important. And And I know you could say, "Oh, yeah, but it it it determines pay and pay is important, but the org chart is not that important." U you know, but I tried that, too. And I I remember I I I didn't never had novice and I there was a whiteboard near my desk and I drew on the whiteboard instead of have an or chart I drew this is what I think our influence chart is and bunch of boxes and arrows and whatever and I asked it like can you look at our email instance and see who's got the most influence and they took a crack at it and anyway the most powerful person at HubSpot at the time this is probably 30 people was a guy named Brad Coffee who ironically came, he was our first intern and just knew everything. And so I wasn't the most influential person. It was this, you know, young guy who was really capable. Um, and I tried that for a while and I I sort of got talked out of that, too. And one of my regrets, Bill, over time is I had some ideas that were like counterintuitive to how you build an org and a little bit like your ideas, and I got talked out of them over time, and I regret some of that. Hm. Yeah. Here's the tricky thing and and I think it just it takes practice and it takes experimentation. Um because you now you notice I said org charts become less important. And what you just described was something where you're trying to replace an org chart with some other kind of chart. But I'm not doing that either. You see it's it's sort of like a lot of these things. can be various methods or or like titles versus no titles, you know, like saying there's going to be no titles is the CEO being in control. Banishing titles. Saying, you know what, titles just don't matter that very much. If if you want some big title, knock yourself out. But frankly, that's just not where the organization is going to put its energy. That's actually not control. That's kind of like saying, we're going to we're going to trust people. And now again, be really careful here. I'm not saying that what we're doing at Bayer is the old uh hire great people and turn them loose. That's a that's a failed plan. That that works. If most people who say that, they only say it because they're not really doing it. Um or if they ever try to really do it, like literally turn everyone loose, it it lasts about a day. Uh it's chaos. And nobody likes chaos. People will take, you know, dictatorship over chaos anyway. So it's we we took out a lot of stuff, but we put back a lot of stuff, too. I mean, we didn't put it back. We put in stuff. So, for example, 90 days, we have these 90-day rituals. You know, every 90 days, the team comes together. First thing they do is they do a retro. Look at, hey, how did things go the last 90 days? Did we achieve the three outcomes we said we were going to achieve? And if we didn't, what why not? What went wrong? You know, so again, not spending days staring at our belly buttons, but like spending, you know, an hour. Hey, what what went wrong? Now, what what are the most important things for the next 90 days? By the way, are we still are we still comfortable with our long-term vision on our team? like we're still trying to launch product X with certain features by certain time. If that if that's that team's kind of longer term vision, still feeling right. Yep. Okay. Um then okay. Now, what are we going to do the next 90 days? This is all all and and we have outcomes, not outputs, not not like um we're going to sell more. That's an output. you know, outcome would be we're going to improve the performance of this part of the product. Yeah. By so much. Um or we're gonna, you know, whatever. It's something the customer says they need. We're going to deliver that. And and so these are these rituals and the fact that everybody's on 90day cycles. The this is a a new or a different way of operating, but it's not one that lacks discipline. Every, by the way, everyone's on the same 90-day cycle. the ideas so that if this team dissolves, there's somewhere for the people to go because there's other teams forming. You see? So, it's it's um it's it's one of these things that a lot of times people get trapped in the idea of control versus sort of decentralization kind of anything goes. We're trying to put in a place, think of it more like a a a really stiff backbone. Y but the arms and the legs can go, you know, go wild. Okay. I like that. Okay. All right. So, you came into Bear over a year ago. Yeah. You made you you pretty quickly you made some massive changes. I have and I have a couple questions on that. Um I guess my first question is um do you think you went too fast or too slow on that? H um I I don't know if you're going to like this answer, but um I think on the one hand we went really fast seems that um and on the other hand I I don't think how I say bear was facing a lot of pretty big challenges and in addition to some sort of technical challenges we faced we had this organizational problem where whereby the people of Bayer were passionate about the company's mission, about the about the quality of the science, about great people. Um, right. But everyone agreed, hey man, we can't get anything done around here. I see this place is so bureaucratic. Now, as I said earlier, I mean, I don't know that I don't know if Bayer was the most bureaucratic company I've seen. Maybe not. But the fact that some of the some of the technical challenges we faced made that bureaucracy really unacceptable, you know, like people will put up with a lot of bureaucracy if sales are growing 10%. Um, and we, you know, we were facing patent experies and things. So people were like, hey, we're we're bureaucratic and we're hosed, man. We we got to like this isn't going to work. So, um I don't think we could have gone slower because if we had gone slower, we you know, we're facing existential threats. Yeah. So, I I I kind of think it's a little bit like baby bears porridge. I I think we've probably gone about the right speed. Okay. and kind of listening to you. This is going to sound weird, but like you some of your ideas sound like Tony Sha's ideas, the CEO of Zapos a while back who had this idea of hocrisy and he was trying to rethink how an organization worked and um actually I was kind of inspired by Tony back in the day. Um, who in like you're doing some pretty unusual stuff. Who are you? Are you just kind of making it up as you go? Am I right? Was are who who inspires you? Is Elon inspiring you? Is who is it? Who is the best turnaround story that you might be follow? Like who are you looking up to? Well, first off, let me say there've been very few turnaround stories of this kind. Most of the organizations that are running a system similar to what I've described, yeah, they built it from the ground up or they implemented it early on. Yeah. So, actually my kind of specialty is doing this in places that are already established. Y and I I um I was I became CEO of Janentech. Uh I basically landed in the role in in second half of 2016 and I found that hey things were things had gotten remarkably bureaucratic for a company that was known for innovation. Yeah. The innovation the innovative spirit was still there. The the culture was okay but the mechanics were broken. I see by the levels and by the governance processes and all this stuff. Right. And at that time I had no idea. I had zero idea what to do about it. I mean I guarantee you I had no idea. In fact I was almost despairing because at that point I'd been I'd been around the organization for 10 years and I knew that during those 10 years there had been non-stop efforts to stop bureaucracy. Yeah. So didn't work. Yeah. And and so that's that's where I mentioned you know this sort of insight that like hey it's not bureaucracy is not an external thing that comes in and and infects this sort of healthy body. The body is designed wrong built built bureaucratic from the ground up. Yeah. It's been built it's been built that way. So um so I spent a couple years there and then I became the CEO of Rosh uh Pharma which is the parent company of Janentech and and so I had uh yeah like six years to practice half seven years to practice this stuff before I got to Bayer and now but I that's part of the answer. So it's not like I just started we started making this stuff up when I got to Bayer that that that could never have happened. It would have been overwhelming. Um, there were lots of inspirations and it wasn't just me. I I mean there was a bunch of people I was working with and I I I I could barely take credit for anything that's in this system. Almost all the insights came from somebody else. Um, there was a book I read called Reinventing Organizations. Yeah. By a guy named Lulu. Have you seen it, Brian? Yeah. I don't think I read it, but I remember hearing about it. Yeah. And it and it talks about teal. Um, and maybe you've heard that term. That's a really interesting read that was that was there um got me started. I learned about this organization Bertzorg in in uh the Netherlands. That's probably the most radical because they have 16,000 employees and two managers. Interesting. Okay. What's it How do you spell that? It's like B U R T Z. One of those. One of those. Okay. Yeah. And And it it it basically Yeah. So the thing and again I'm not I'm not hung up on the statistics. It's the shock factor because you go wow 16,000 employees and two managers. Well if um if you have a performance problem who do you think deals with that the managers or the employees? I think you're going to say employees right? If uh got to decide about um you know u we we need our team can't handle the workload um we need to split into two teams. Who who do you think decides that the management or the employees? And so on performance evaluation who do you think does that the management or the employees? Employees. And the answer to everything is basically the employees. and they have like 30 coaches and 30 whatever you call it back office, you know, payroll and whatever, right? And then and then the other tens of thousands are all individual contributors um doing their work and and so going to school on that and then saying how in the world do you apply that to a complex integrated product development life science company where there's so many interdependencies because at Bertzorg they they have a bunch of teams that are like yeah thousand literally thousands of teams but they're all kind of doing the same work because they're they're providing home health care services. So they they're they're somewhat independent, right? They they don't have to coordinate across all these teams. But if you're if you're developing a new pharmaceutical, you know, a new medicine, that might require two or three thousand people to put their hands on that over a over a 12 or 15 year period from all different functions and right. So so that's why we don't have two managers uh at Bayer. You need a little more coordination than that. You need more Yeah. more more support and coordination. Okay. One thing I've noticed about a lot of the CEOs I admire like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk and Jensen Hong, mostly tech is they have exceptionally thick skin and they're almost immune to criticism. Like they're alligator skin. you must have gotten a lot of criticism for your approach particularly from all the layers that you you probably pushed out or do you have exceptionally thick skin or does it does it hit you between the eyes and for me I don't and I think one of my weaknesses as a CEO is I'm a bit of a pleaser I wanted to be popular and as I look back at my tenure I kind of wish I I was tougher and I I could withstand criticism better but where are you on the spectrum of alligator skin versus me. Let let me offer you an observation. Those CEOs you mentioned, they're a bit of a type. They are these are these are kind of innovator uh product innovators and that is that's that can be a great kind of CEO, great kind of leader. Um, but that's a very distinctive kind of leader. And uh, it, by the way, it has certain positive features and others that are not so positive. I I'm I'm not going to name names because I don't want to get into name calling or that kind of thing, but some of the people on your list were pretty pretty hopeless organization managers and they had to put people in place around them that could actually make the organization work because if it was up if if they were in charge of making the organization work, it wouldn't it would fall apart. Yep. All right. So, you kind of One, by the way, one thing I noticed about all of them is they're all lifelong learners big time. Yep. Yep. And they're all a bit of compulsive. They're obsessed. And yeah, they did bring in people, but most of them got better at it over time. Like Steve Jobs got a lot better at it. Bill Gates got a lot better at it. They all got better at it over time. They they knew to if they they want to achieve their dream, they had to improve on. So they all worked on their the CEO craft. Anyway, back to you. Are you thick or thin skinned? Yeah. Okay. Okay. But but I I just I do want to make the point. Okay. Okay. You got to decide what you're trying to be. You know, in other words, for your listeners that are that are trying to grow as a CEO, you got to be you got to be the person you are, too. Do you know, like I'm um I'm I'm a nerd big time, you know, engineer. I love the product stuff. I love You're a scientist, right? I'm a chemical engineer. I have I have a masters in chemical engineering and and you know so but I'm but I've decided that I'm not I'm not using any of those guys you mentioned as my phenomen because a lot of those guys they they are really product visionaries like that is their thing and that's a beautiful thing that's a beautiful gift but um I'm going on different mode I want that if if we have 90,000 people at bear I want to have I if in those 90,000 there's a thousand that could be product visionaries, I want to make sure that they're they're product visionaries coming through. Yeah. That and and so um so I'm not talking about being a professional manager, by the way. I I faulted that. But anyway, you just got to have a you got to have a picture for what it is you're going to be. And then back to the thick thin skin. Um, I'm I'm I'm ex I'm sorry. I'm internally referenced. Okay. But I'm but I'm I'm socially sensitive. So what I mean by this is um if somebody f first up internally referenced versus externally referenced. Some people do you know you ask them hey h how are you doing today? They say well how are you? you know, like they they're they're they so reflect the people around them and if if everyone else around them's happy, they're happy, you know, as an example. And that and that's I'm not judging that. That's is that a thing that people talk? I've never heard of that internally referenced. Is that a Yeah, there's is that like a psychology term that I missed somewhere? Thing called neurallinginguistic programming and there's like a hundred different ways to um it's actually pretty cool. parametrically you can you can kind of form judgments. I don't mean negative judgments but like just get to understand people better. I'll give you another example R. Another one's a time constant. You know what's your time constant? So some people a long time is you know a century and other people a long time is six months or a month. You know what's your I'm kind of in between. I'm probably a long time. you're internally referenced. Internally referenced. I'm a little externally referenced, which I think is a bug, not a feature. Yeah, that it can be being externally referenced um makes you a lot better at a lot of things like you tend to be better with empathy. You tend to be right um you don't miss people's birthdays or you you don't you know you don't say the wrong thing and offend someone as much if you're externally referenced generally. Okay. Um, it can be really hard on you, especially if you're in the business of making hard decisions or changing things. So, I'm I'm I'm internally referenced, but I actually care a lot if if somebody says, "I hate you." Well, I got some hate mail recently. Uh, actually, not it was about a product. It was a It was like a customer kind of thing. and and and the person really said some really mean things about me and they were just they were venting, but I wrote them back and just said, "Hey, I'm really sorry about this, but I I don't think you're what you said is quite fair. You know, let me say this." And and then they wrote me back and they were like, "Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry I wrote that." Uh I I didn't think that that someone would actually read this and and um so I I do I do care. Um, but my my personal So maybe my my ethics is that I care what people think, but my personality is that that I'm pretty Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Got it. Okay. One other topic while I got you. This is in in my world. There's a lot of CEOs who've been CEO for a couple of decades. like I'm in this segment of the software industry software as a service and some of the CEOs are getting tired um and they're thinking about you know retiring what advice do you have to those CEOs and to the boards of directors of those companies if they're hiring should they hire internally or externally um and why and the trend in Silicon Valley is is internal um Google Microsoft like most of the big ones But there are some external that worked out like Uber's worked out pretty well. Um so advice for boards internal or external pluses and minuses and then I guess if external well answer that one first then we'll get so you have to understand I'm I'm like the opposite of say your experience because you became CEO at a very young age and you grew with the company and I um I actually I kind of done I've done almost every level job in a company. Yeah. Like if if Bear has if if Bear had 12 layers when I arrived, I I pretty much worked at each of those. Yeah. And um which is which is a um it's actually a real asset in a way. Um but on the other hand, it's like you can age out, you know what I mean? Like that doesn't work if it uh you know, if you turn 100 before you get to the top, then tire out. Yeah. That's not going to really work. Uh I've also been exposed to these questions before about like for example I've been the guy who was ready to be a CEO but because nine out of 10 large companies are going to hire inside it's almost like the the supervisory board if they're going outside it's it's a mark of a crisis a problem something's wrong something's wrong like they didn't do their succession planning right okay and and so I've even the guys at times sitting there thinking, "Wow, I'm really ready to do this and I've got all the experience. I got, you know, because my my first I got my first job as as the CEO of of a publicly traded company at 56." You know, there were times earlier on when I was as ready as I was when I was 56, but I I just didn't get the job. Y and there were times where I saw big companies hiring some internal person, even some internal person that I knew, and I thought, you know, they really settled there. Um uh and and so I I think the the best answer I can give you is you got to hire someone who's awesome. And a lot of times what CEOs do is they they have someone who's a number two. Yep. and they think that that's the natural person and they don't realize that this is a person who thrived in their shadow. Um but whether that person really is going to stand alone and be the person who because or they think oh they'll maintain what I built but there's no maintenance mode. Yeah. I don't think there is either. If you're in maintenance mode it's like you're either changing or you're dead. Yep. Um okay. If you're a board of directors and you're hiring from the outside and you hire that person, what advice do you have to that CEO who's joining? You mean like they're are they're interviewing or they're they're they got the job and now they're coming in. Yeah. You hired a new CEO from the outside. You're let's say Google. Let's just say if Google let their CEO go and they're hiring someone from the outside, what advice do you give to that new CEO of Google if that were the case? I don't know. You got to get to know the company. You You gotta You got to get to know the business. I don't know if I have any big brilliant insight on this. You know, let me let let me let me put some words in your mouth. I think what you did was you kind of tore the house down and rebuilt it. At least the org structure and the way it was managed. And I actually think that's right. If you're looking from the outside, some something's probably wrong. And I think the first I think you should be aggressive. And I think you should be aggressive really. I think you've played your cards right. Um and so like someone from the outside takes over Google. I don't think they should make incremental change. I think they should make large change. Um I I think you I think you played your cards very well. And the other turnaround that I really respect is Dra. I don't know how to say his last name at um Uber. You know, he gets criticized a lot, but I think he's done a really nice job there. Uh changed culture a lot. Like right out of the gate, big change. I think that's the playbook for external. I actually oddly think that's the playbook for internal. Like I, you know, we did this at HubSpot. Uh Yamin Rangan, who is my number two, took over when I uh stepped aside and she's done great. But actually in in a little bit of the advice in the in the playbook was like keep it going. Let's not mess it up. I actually think the playbook if I had to adise her, you know, today was like go make make change right away. make big change right away because I don't think you want to be a I think caretaker CEOs are I think that's a death no. Yeah, you're you're right on. You know, I think probably the the point is almost every organization whether they're whether they're in a crisis or whether they're in a great place. If if they're in a crisis, then obviously the new leader needs to come in and really quickly get to know the people, figure out who they can trust. uh you know assess the situation and and come to at least some highlevel conclusions and start moving that direction as fast as they can bringing the organization along. That's kind of obvious. But if if you're if you're named to be the CEO in some place where let's say there's been a successful CEO for 10 years and you're coming in, you should never think like, "Oh, this is just going to be I just need to keep it going." Because chances are whatever flaws that person had because we all have flaws. Yeah. The organization's going to reflect those flaws. Yep. And if they were flaws of inaction, if they were kind of had like swept things under the rug, if they let the organization get too bloated or too, you know, like decision-m slowed down and it can be really um misleading because you can have a situation where you come in and like, oh, the employee engagement survey is off the chart. Yeah. and everybody loved the old CEO and then you come in and you find like oh but everyone says they can't get anything done and you might think oh well I guess I don't need big changes because you know everyone liked it. Now, sometimes people can really like some place because it's comfortable and because they like their peers and they like the sound of the mission, but if if they're not getting a lot done, then then the organization's kind of become content. And that's really dangerous. So, you got to you might think, oh, I'm just coming in and everything's going to be, you know, kind of smooth and like and you may find, oh, wow, this this place actually needs a reboot. Um, even though all the all the signs look good. Yeah. Okay. Last question. I a lot of the listeners are in tech. They're executives in tech. They're early in their careers. They're founders of tech companies. Advice to people who are early in the CEO journey. Advice to people who want to become CEOs. Um, go make it your business to talk to a lot of people. Ask Ask experienced leaders for time to talk. You know, most people that are Brian, you're you're younger than I am, but um, you know, most most people that are later in their career, they're they're really glad to they are help. I am. And you know, there's a lot of things that I I wish I knew when I was, you know, whatever, 38, but I know when I'm 58. Um, so I I think getting advice don't like really trust trust your people. Trust the people who work for you to get to to shape you, to train you. I I know probably the most of the mistakes I made early in my leadership was thinking that I was supposed to have the answers or that I'm supposed to be like this um invulnerable person who's you know and you can be confident but still very open and very approachable you know so so you you don't be like showing up like well I don't know whether our company should exist and I don't know whether we really have a good mission I'm not talking about that but to to show up and say, "Hey, this this company's really important. Our mission is great. Our technology is great, but boy, I could really use your advice. Um, I don't think I'm that good of a leader, and I'd really appreciate any input you have on how I can be more effective at helping the company." I think that's incredible advice. It's disarmingly. It's disarming. It's incredibly useful advice, I think. Yeah. I app Bill, I appreciate you. I appreciate what you're doing at Bayer. It's fascinating. and you're setting a template. I hope you're wildly successful and the company is a trillion dollar company someday and you're on the Mount Rushmore of CEOs. I appreciate you very much. Thanks for coming on the show and giving us all your wisdom. Yeah, thanks Brian. Really enjoyed it and look forward to seeing you in in Boston one of these days. That'd be great. Okay, I hope you guys like that. I'll give you my take. Bill's trying to kind of pull the bureaucracy out of a 100,000 person organization. I think where I kind of come out is I want to figure out how I help a company going from 10 employees to a thousand employees so that bureaucracy never shows up. It doesn't slow down. That pace continues. And when I thought about it and kind of went through it in my head, there was a bunch of things that came up that kind of slow companies down. Annual planning and budgeting can slow things down. We did this at HubSpot around 50 employees. We got pretty serious about how we did it. It helped a lot and I recommend it. But I recommend doing shorter cycles. I think if I had a doover, particularly now with everything going on with AI, I do my planning and I do my budgeting in six months increments. Layers can slow things down and that's definitely true. The more layers you have, the more kind of bureaucracy and it slows down. In particular, I found the director layer, that kind of real middle layer in the org. When that showed up, things slowed down a little bit for HubSpot. A lot of those directors were fantastic and became VPs and seale folks, but they can slow it down. So, I would push off that director layer as long as I can. And I would keep the span of reports, span of coaching as Bill would say, to at least 1 to 10. I wouldn't have like one person with three direct reports. I don't think that's a good idea. Third thing is in and I hear this from a lot of CEOs is you know mercenaries can slow things down and as a founder I was always kind of managing that missionary to mercenary ratio. You're going to end up having to build the company with a lot of mercenaries. So you can't totally ignore them. I think I would just try to push it out as long as I can. We hired some amazing mercenaries at HubSpot that helped us scale and so don't completely throw that baby out in the bathwater or charts and titles. Those can gum up the works a little bit. I tried to get rid of both at HubSpot around 50 employees. I banned the org chart and I banned titles and I stuck with it for about six to nine months, but I went back and we we built an org chart and we gave everyone titles again. There's so much time spent on work charts and titles and it's exhausting. But the upside of them in terms of the organization versus the downside, I think the upside outweighs the downside. So, I wouldn't kill those if I were you. Uh 101 ones. One-on ones definitely slow things down and jam the CEO's calendar. I personally like how Jensen Hang runs things. He doesn't have one-on- ons. He has like 50 direct reports and he gives feedback, tough feedback and good feedback in public. I sort of like the way he runs the business. And honestly, in HubSpot in the early days, I didn't have one-on ones. I had these large meetings and I kind of regret going with the more traditional one-on- ones, the small meetings and stuff like that. Uh, I think Jess's got it right. compensation and compensation bands can slow things down. Yes, but eventually you're going to need them. I think they're healthy. I think where companies get in trouble is where the the compensation system and the org structure are kind of perfectly matched. Uh I think you need to decouple the position in the org chart with the comp. In an extreme example of this is Zuckerberg hiring, you know, developers, scientists making hund00 million, which is probably a lot more than his VPs. You know, I don't know about that, but definitely inside of your organization, you've got individual contributors who are adding as much if not more value than some of your VPs. So, I would decouple those things that if I had had to do over. There's a lot of talk in Silicon Valley amongst my CEO friends about professional managers, when to bring them in, are they good? Aren't they good? You're going to need professional managers eventually. My advice would be to push it off until, call it post 100 employees. Try to build with your crew. Try to build that early crew and the homegrown talent. But eventually, you need them. Like for example, you're going to need a VP of sales probably at 100 employees. You're going to need a general counsel with experience being a lawyer at 500 employees. You're going to need a CFO at some point. Like HubSpot couldn't have gone public without a CFO that had seen the movie before. So, I would push them out. I'd also try to avoid hiring those professional managers from ginormous companies. There's just kind of an impedance mismatch there. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed it. Uh, I had fun doing it. If you want to keep the conversation going, ping me on X. I'm bhagan. Take care.
