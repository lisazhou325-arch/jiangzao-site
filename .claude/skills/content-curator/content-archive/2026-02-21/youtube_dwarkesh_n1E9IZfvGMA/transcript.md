So, we talked three years ago. I'm curious, in your view, what has been the biggest update of the last three years? What has been the biggest difference between what it felt like last three years versus now? Yeah. I would say actually, the underlying technology like the exponential of the technology, has has gone broadly speaking, I would say about, about as I expected it to go. I mean, there's like plus or minus you know, a, a couple. .. There's plus or minus a year or two here there's plus or minus a year or two there. I don't know that I would have predicted the specific direction of code. Um, but, but actually when I look at the exponential it, it is roughly what I expected in terms of the march of the models from like you know, smart high school student to smart college student to like you know, beginning to do PhD and professional stuff and in the case of code, reaching beyond that. So, you know, the frontier is a little bit uneven. It's roughly what I expected. I will tell you though what the most surprising thing has been. The most surprising thing has been the lack of public recognition of how close we are to the end of the exponential. To me, it is absolutely wild that you know, you have peop- y- you know within the bubble and outside the bubble, you know but, but you have people talking about these these, you know, just the same tired old hot button political issues and like, you know, a- a- around us we're like (laughs) near the end of the exponential. I, I want to understand what that exponential looks like right now because the first question I asked you when we recorded three years ago was you know, what's up with scaling? How, why does it work? Um, I have a similar question now but I feel like it's a more complicated question because at least from the public's point of view- Yes. . .. three years ago, there were these, you know well-known public trends where across many orders of magnitude of compute you could see how the loss improves. And now we have RL scaling and there's no publicly known scaling law for it. It's not even clear what exactly the story is of is this supposed to be teaching the model skills? Is this supposed to be teaching meta-learning? Um, what is the scaling hypothesis at this point? Yeah. So, so I have actually the same hypothesis that I had even all the way back in 2017. So in 2017, I think I talked about it last time but I wrote a doc called The, The Big Blob of Compute Hypothesis. And, a- and, you know, it it wasn't about the scaling of language models in particular. When I, when I wrote it, GPT-1 had had just come out, right? So that was, you know, one among many things right? There was, back in those days, there was robotics people tried to work on reasoning as a separate thing from language models. There was scaling of the kind of RL that happened i- that, that, you know, kind of happened in AlphaGo and uh, you know, that, that happened at Dota at OpenAI, and, um, you know people remember StarCraft at DeepMind, you know the AlphaStar. Um, so, uh, it was written as a more general document and and the specific thing I said was the following. That, and you know, it's, it's very you know, Rich Sutton put out The bi- Bitter Lesson a couple years later um, uh, but, you know, the the hypothesis is, is basically the same. So, so what it says is all the cleverness all the techniques, all, all the kind of we need a new method to, to do something like that doesn't matter very much. There are only a few things that matter and I think I listed seven of them. One is like, how much raw compute you have. The other is the quantity of data that you have. Then the third is kind of the quality and distribution of data right? It needs to be a broad, broad distribution of data. The fourth is, I think how long you train for. Um, the fifth is you need an objective function that can scale to the moon. So, the pre-training objective function is one such objective function right? An- another objective function is, you know the, the kind of RL objective function that says like you have a goal, you're gonna go out and reach the goal. Within that, of course, there's objective rewards like you know, like you see in math and coding and there's more subjective rewards like you see in RL from human feedback or kind of higher order higher order versions of that. And, and then the sixth and seventh were things around kind of like normalization or conditioning like, you know, just getting the numerical stability so that kind of the big blob of compute flows in this laminar way instead of instead of running into problems. So, that was the hypothesis, and it's the hypothesis I still hold. I, I don't think I've seen very much that is not in line with that hypothesis. And so the pre-train scaling laws were one example of w- of of, of, of kind of what we see there. And indeed, those have continued going, like you know, uh, you know, I think I think now it's been, it's been widely reported like you know, we feel good about pre-training like pre-training is continuing to give us gains. What has changed is that now we're also seeing the same thing for RL right? So we're seeing a pre-training phase and then we're seeing like an RL phase on top of that. Um, and with RL, it's, it's actually just the same like, you know, e- even, even other companies have have published, um, uh, um, like um, you know, i- in some of their in some of their releases have published things that say "Look, you know, we trained the model on math contests you know, AIME or, or the kind of other things and you know, how well, how well the model does is log-linear in how long we've trained it. " And we see that as well, and it's not just math contests. It's a wide variety of RL tasks, and so we're seeing the same scaling in RL that we saw for pre-training Um you mentioned Rich, Richard Sutton and The Bitter Lesson. Yeah. I interviewed him, uh, last year, and he is actually very non-LLM-pilled. And if I'm, if I. .. I don't know if this is his perspective but one way to paraphrase this objection is something like look, something which possesses the true core of human learning would not require all these billions of dollars of data and compute and these bespoke environments to learn how to use Excel or how does an acc- you know how to, how to use PowerPoint, how to navigate a web browser. And the fact that we have to build in these skills using these RL environments hints that we're actually lacking this. .. .. . core human learning algorithm, uh, and so we're scaling the wrong thing. And so yeah, that, that does raise the question why are we doing all this RL scaling if we do think there's something that's gonna be human-like in its ability to learn on the fly? Yeah, yeah. So I think, I think this kinda puts together several things that should be kind of thought of thought of differently. Yeah. I think there is a genuine puzzle here but it, it may not matter. Um, uh, in fact, I would guess it probably it probably doesn't matter. So, let take the RL out of it for a second 'cause I actually think RL. .. and it's a red herring to say that RL is any different from pre-training in this matter. Um, so if we, if we look at pre-training scaling um, it, it was very interesting. Back in, you know, 2017 when Alec Radford was doing GPT-1. If you look at the models before GPT-1 they were trained on these data sets that didn't represent a wide you know, distribution of text, right? You had, like, you know, these very standard you know, kind of language modeling benchmarks and GPT-1 itself was trained on a bunch of I think it was fan fiction, actually. Mm-hmm. Um, but, you know, it was it was, like, literary, you know it was like literary text, which is a very small fraction of the texts that you get. And what we found with that, you know. .. and, and in those days it was like, a billion words or something. So small data sets, and m- represented a pretty narrow distribution right? Like a narrow distribution of kind of what what you can see, what you can see in the world. And it didn't generalize well. If you did better on, um, you know the, the, the. .. I, I, you know, I fo- I forget what it was some, some kind of fan fiction corpus um, it wouldn't generalize that well to kind of the other ta-. .. you know, we had all these measures of like, you know, "How well does the how well does the model do at predicting all of these other kinds of texts? " You really didn't see the generalization. It was only when you trained over all the tasks on the i- uh you know, you know, the internet, when you when you kind of did a general internet scrape right? From something like, you know, Common Crawl or scraping links on Reddit which is what we did for GPT-2. It's only wh- when you do that, that you kind of started to get generalization. Um, and I think we're seeing the same thing on RL that we're starting with, first, very simple RL tasks like training on math competitions. Then, we're kind of moving to, you know kind of broader, broader training that involves things like code as a task and now we're moving to do kind of many many other tasks. And then I think we're going to increasingly get generalization. So that, that kind of takes out the RL versus the pre-training side of it. But I think there is a puzzle here either way which is that on pre-training, when we train the model on pre-training you know, we, we use, like trillions of tokens, right? And, and humans don't see trillions of words so there is an actual sample efficiency difference here. There, there is actually something different that's that's happening here, which is that the models start from scratch and you know, they have to get m- much more much more training. But we also see that once they're trained if we give them a long context length the only thing blocking a long context length is like, inference. But if we give them, like, a context length of a million they're very good at learning and adapting within that context length. And, and so I don't know the full answer to this but, but I think there's something going on that pre-training it's, it's not like the process of humans learning. It's somewhere between the process of humans learning and the process of human evolution. It's like it's somewhere between, like, we get many of our priors from evolution. Our brain isn't just a blank slate, right Right. Whole books have been written about. I think the language models, they're much more blank slates. They literally start as, like, random weights. Whereas the human brain starts with all these regions it's connected to all these inputs and outputs. Um, and, and so maybe we should think of pre-training and for that matter, RL as well, as as being something that exists in the middle space between human evolution and you know, kind of human on- o- on-the-spot learning. And as the in-context learning that the models do as as something between long-term human learning and short-term human learning. So, you know, there, there's this hierarchy of like, there's evolution, there's long-term learning, there's short-term learning and there's just human reaction. And the LLM phases exist along the spectrum but not necessarily exactly at the same points that there's no analog to some of the human modes of learning that LLMs are kind of falling between the points. Mm-hmm. Does that make sense? Um, yes, although the, the. .. some things are still a bit confusing. For example, if the analogy is that this is like evolution so it's fine that it's not that sample efficient. Then, like, well, if we're gonna get the kind of super sample efficient agent from in-context learning why are we bothering to build in, you know. .. there's RL environment companies which are. .. uh, it seems like what they're doing is they're teaching it how to use this API how to use Slack, how to use whatever. It's confusing to me why there's so much emphasis on that if the kind of agent that can just learn on the fly is emerging or is gonna soon emerge or has has already emerged. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I, I, I mean, I can't speak for the emphasis of anyone else. I can, I can only talk about how we how we think about it. I think the way we think about it is the goal is not to teach the model every possible skill within RL just as we don't do that within pre-training right? Within pre-training, we're not trying to expose the model to you know, every, every possible, uh you know, way that words could be put together right? You know, we're. .. it's, it's rather that the model trains on a lot of things and then and then it reaches generalization across pre-training, right? That was, that was the transition from GPT-1 to GPT-2 that I saw up close which is, like, you know, the the model reaches a point, you know. .. I, I, like, had these moments where I was like "Oh yeah, you just give the model like. .. you just give the model a list of numbers that's like you know, um, you know, this is the cost of the house this is the square feet of the house and the model completes the pattern and does linear regression. " Like, not great, but it does it. But it's never seen that exact thing before. And, and so to, you know, to to the extent that we are building these RL environments the g- the goal is, is very similar to what is be-. .. you know, to what was done five or 10 years ago with pre-training with we're trying to get a wh- we're trying to get a whole bunch of data not because we wanna cover a specific document or a specific skill but because we want to generalize. I mean, I-I, I think the framework you're laying down obviously makes sense. Like we're making progress towards AGI. I think the crux is something like nobody at this point disagrees that we're gonna achieve AGI in this century. And the crux is you say we're hitting the end of the exponential um, and somebody else looks at this and says "Oh, yeah, we've m- we're making progress. We've been making progress since 2012, and then 2035 we'll have a human-like agent. " And so I want to understand what it is that you're seeing which makes you think um, yeah, obviously we're seeing the kinds of things that evolution did or that human within the human lifetime learning is like in th- these models. And why think that it's one year away and not ten years away? I, I- Yeah. . .. I actually think of it as like two. .. there's kind of two cases to be made here or like two, two claims you could make one of which is like stronger and the other of which is weaker. So I think starting, starting with the weaker claim you know, when, when I first saw the scaling back in like you know, 2019, um, you know I wasn't sure. You know, this was s- the whole this was kind of a 50/50 thing, right? I thought I saw something that was, you know. .. An- and- and my claim was this is much more likely than anyone thinks it is like this is wild, no one else would even consider this maybe there's a 50% chance this happens. Um, on the basic hypothesis of, eh you know, as you put it, within ten years we'll get to you know, you know, what I call kinda country of geniuses- Right. . .. in the data center. I'm at like 90% on that. Um, and it's hard to go much higher than 90% 'cause the world is so unpredictable. Yeah. Um, maybe the irreducible uncertainty would be if we were at 95% where you get to things like I don't know, may- maybe multi- you know multiple companies have, you know, kind of internal turmoil and nothing happens and then Taiwan gets invaded and like all the all the fabs get blown up by missiles and and, you know, and then- Now you're doing a scenario. (laughs) Yeah, yeah, yeah. You, you, you know, just, you can construct a a scenario where there's like a 5% chance that it it, or, you know, you can construct a 5% world- Yeah. . .. where like things, things get delayed for t- for for, for, for, for, for ten years. That's maybe 5%. There's another 5% which is that I'm very confident on tasks that can be verified. So I think, I think with coding I'm just except for that irreducible uncertainty, there's just there's. .. I mean, I think we'll be there in one or two years. There's no way we will not be th- there in ten years in terms of being able to do it end-to-end coding. My one little bit, the one little bit of of f- fundamental uncertainty, even on long time scales is this thing about tasks that aren't verifiable like planning a mission to Mars, like uh, you know, doing some fundamental scientific discovery like like CRISPR, like, you know, writing a writing a novel. Hard to, hard to verify those tasks. I am almost certain that w- we have a reliable path to get there but like if there was a little bit uncertainty it's there. So, so, so, so, so on the ten years I'm like, you know, 90%, which is about as certain as you can be. Like I think it's, I think it's crazy to say that this won't happen by by, by 2035. Like in some sane world, it would be outside the mainstream. But, but the emphasis on verification hints to me as a lack of a lack of, uh, belief that these models will generalize. If you think about humans- Yes. . .. we are good at things that both which we get verifiable reward and things which we don't. You're like, you haven't (. .. ) We, we, oh, no, no no, no. This is, this is why I'm almost sure. We already see substantial generalization from things that that verify to things that don't ver- we're already seeing that. Right. But it, but it seems like you're emphasizing this as a spectrum which will uh, split apart, which domains see- Yeah yeah, the- . .. some more progress. And I'm like but that's, that doesn't seem like how humans get better. The, the, the world in which we don't make it or, or, or the world in which we don't get there is the world in which we do, we do all the things that are that are verifiable and then they like, you know many of them generalize but what we kinda don't get fully there. We don't, we don't, we don't fully you know, c- we don't fully color in this side of the box. It's, it's, it's not a, it's not a binary thing. But, but it also seems to me is that even in even in a world where generalization is weak and you only (. .. ) domains, it's not clear to me in such a world you could automate software engineering because software en. .. Like in some sense you are, "A software engineer. " Yeah. Yeah. But you, part of being a software engineer for you involves writing these like long memos about your grand vision about- That's right. . .. different things. And so- Well, I don't think that's part of the job of SWE. That's par- that's part of the job of the company. That's right. But I do think SWE involves like design documents- Right. . .. and other things like that. Um, which by the way, the, the models are not bad. They're already pretty good at writing comments, re-. .. And so with, with, a- again, a- again I'm making like much weaker claims here than I believe to like you know, to, to, to, to to kind of set up a, a a, you know, to, to distinguish between two things. Like we're, we're already almost there for software engineering. We are already almost there. By, by what metric? The- there's one metric which is like how many lines of code are written by AI? Yes. And if you use, if you consider other productivity improvements in the course of the history of software engineering compilers write all the lines of software and. .. But we. .. There's a difference between how many lines are written and how big the productivity improvement is. Oh, yeah. And so- And, um, and then like we're almost there meaning like the h- how big is the productivity improvement not just how many lines are written. Yeah, yeah. So, so I actually, um, I actually I actually agree with you on this. So I, I've made this series of predictions on um, code and software engineering and, and and I think people have repeatedly kind of misunderstood them. So, so let me, let m- let me let me, let me lay out the spectrum right? Like I think it was like, you know like, you know, eight, eight or nine months ago or something I said you know, the AI model will be writing 90 90% of the lines of code in like you know, three to six months, which which happened at least at some places, right? It happened, happened at Anthropic, happened with many people downstream using our models. But, but that's actually a very weak criterion right? People thought I was saying like we won't need 90% of the software engineers. Those things are worlds apart, right? Like I would put the spectrum as 90% of code is written by the model-. .. 100% of code is written by the model and that's a big difference in productivity. Um, 90% of the end-to-end SWE tasks right, including things like compiling, including things like setting up clusters and environments testing features, writing memos, 90% of the SWE tasks are written by the models. 100% of today's SWE tasks are, are are, are written by the models. And, and even when, when, when that happens doesn't mean software engineers are out of a job. Like, there's like new higher level things they can do- Right. . .. or they can, they can manage. And then there's a further down the spectrum like, you know, there's 90% less demand for SWEs which I think will happen, but like this this, this is a spectrum. And, you know, I, I wrote about it in in The Adolescence of Technology where I went through this kind of spectrum with farming. Um, uh, uh, and so I I actually totally agree with you on that it's just these are very different benchmarks from each other but we're proceeding through them super fast. It seems like in part of your vision it's like going from 90 to 100. Um, first, it's gonna happen fast, and two that somehow that leads to huge productivity improvements um, whereas when I notice even in greenfield projects that people start with cloud code or something people report starting a lot of projects and I'm like "Do we see in the world out there a renaissance of software? " All these new features that wouldn't exist otherwise. And at least so far, it doesn't seem like we see that and so that does make me wonder, even if even if like I never had to intervene on cloud code um, there is this thing of like there's just w- the world is complicated jobs are complicated, and closing the loop on self-contained systems whether just writing software or something, how much sort of how much broader gains we would see just from that. And so m- maybe that makes us, that should- Yeah. So- . .. dilute our estimation of the- I, I- . .. country of geniuses. I, I, well, well, I actually I, I, like, I, like, simultaneously I simultaneously agree with you, agree that it's a reason why these things don't happen instantly but at the same time, I think the the, the effect is gonna be very fast. So, like, I don't know, you could have these two poles right? One is like, um, you know, AI is like you know, it's not gonna make progress it's slow, like, it's gonna take, you know kinda forever to diffuse within the economy, right? Economic diffusion has become one of these buzzwords that's like a a reason why we're not gonna make AI progress or why AI progress doesn't matter. And, and, you know, the other axis is like we'll get recursive self-improvement you know, the whole thing, you know can't you just draw an exponential line on the on the curve, you know? It's, it's g- we're gonna have, you know Dyson spheres around the sun and, like you know, y- y- you know, so many nanoseconds after uh- (laughs) . .. you know, after, after we get recurs- I mean I'm, uh, completely caricaturing the view here but, like, you know, there, there there are these two extremes. But what we've seen from, from the beginning you know, at least if you look within Anthropic there's this bizarre 10X per year growth in revenue that we've seen right? So, you know, in 2023, it was like zero to 100 million 2024 it was 100 million to a billion 2025 it was a billion to like nine or ten billion and then- You guys should have just bought like a billion dollars worth of your own products so you could just like have a clean 10B. (laughs) Th- the, and, and the first- (laughs). . .. month of this year, like, that, that exponential is con- you would think it would slow down but it, it would like, you know we, we added another few billion to like you know, to, to, to, we added another few billion to revenue in January. And, and so, you know, o- obviously that curve can't go on forever right? You know, the GDP is only so large. I don't, you know, I, I would even guess that it bends that it bends, bends somewhat this year. But like that is like a fast curve right? That's like a, that's like a really fast curve and I would bet it stays pretty fast even as the scale goes to the entire economy. So like I, I think we should be thinking about this middle world where things are like extremely fast but not instant. Where they take time because of economic diffusion because of the need to close the loop because, you know, it's like this fiddly "Oh, man, I have to do change management within my enterprise. You know, I have to, like, you know uh, uh, you know, I, I I, like, I set this up but but, you know, I have to change the security permissions on this in order to make it actually work. Or, you know, I had this, like old piece of software that, you know that, like, you know, checks the model before it's compiled and and, and, like, released and I have to rewrite it. And yes, the model can do that but I have to tell the model to do that and it has to, it has to take time to do that. " And, and, and so I think everything we've seen so far is is compatible with the idea that there's one fast exponential that's the the capability of the model and then there's another fast exponential that's downstream of that which is the diffusion of the model into the economy. Not instant, not slow, much faster than any previous technology but it has its limits. And, and, and, and this is what we you know, when I, when I look inside Anthropic when I look at our customers, fast adoption but not infinitely fast. Um- Can I try a hot take on you? Yeah. I feel like diffusion is cope that people use to say when it's like i- if the model isn't able to do something they're like, "Oh, but the diffu- it's like a diffusion issue. " But then you should use the comparison to humans. You would think that the inherent advantages that AIs have would make diffusion a much easier problem for new AIs getting onboarded than new humans getting onboarded. So an AI can read your entire Slack and your Drive in minutes. They can share all the knowledge that the other copy other copies of the same instance have. You don't have this adverse selection problem when you're hiring AIs 'cause you can just hire copies of a vetted AI model. Um, hiring a human is, like, so much more hassle and people hire humans all the time, right? We pay humans upwards of $50 trillion in wages because they're useful uh, even though it's, like, in principle it would be much easier to integrate AIs into the economy than it is to hire humans. I think, like, the diffusion, I feel like doesn't really explain- So, no, I, I I think diffusion is very real, AI d-And and, and, and doesn't have to, you know doesn't exclusively have to do with limitation, limitation limitations on the AI models. Like, again, there are people who use diffusion to to, you know, as kind of a buzzword to say this isn't a big deal. I'm not talking about that. I'm not talking about, you know, AI will diffuse at the speed that previous. I think AI will diffuse much faster than previous technologies have but, but not infinitely fast. So, I'll, I'll, I'll just give an example of this right? Like, there's, like, Claude Code. Like, Claude Code is extremely easy to set up. Um, you know, if you're a developer you can kind of just start using Claude Code. There is no reason why a developer at a large enterprise should not be adopting Claude Code as quickly as you know, a, a, a individual developer or developer at a startup. And we do everything we can to promote it right? We sell, uh, we sell Claude Code to enterprises. And big enterprises, like, you know, big c- big financial companies big pharmaceutical companies, all of them, they're adopting Claude Code much faster than enterprises typically adopt new technology right? But, but again, it, like, it it, it, it, it takes time. Like, any given feature or any given product like Claude Code or, like, Cowork, will get adopted by the you know, the individual developers who are on Twitter all the time by the, like, Series A startups many months faster tha- tha- than you know, th- than they will get adopted by like, you know, a, a, a like, large enterprise that does food sales. Um, there are a number of factors. Like, you have to go through legal. You have to provision it for everyone. It has to, you know, like, it has to pass security and compliance. The leaders of the company who are further away from the AI revolution you know, are, are forward-looking, but they have to say "Oh, it makes sense for us to spend 50 million. This is what this Claude Code thing is. This is why it helps our company. This is why it makes us more productive. " And then they have to explain to the people two levels below and they have to say, "Okay, we have 3 000 developers. Like, here's how we're gonna roll it out to our developers. " And we have conversations like this every day. Like, you know, we are doing everything we can to make Anthropic's revenue grow 20 or 30X a year instead of 10X a year um, you know. And, and, and again, you know many enterprises are just saying, "This is so productive like, you know, we're gonna take shortcuts in our usual procurement process " right? They're moving much faster than, you know when we tried to sell them just the ordinary API which many of them use, but Claude Code is a more compelling product. Um, but it's not an infinitely compelling product and I don't think even AGI or powerful AI or country of geniuses in the data center will be an infinitely compelling product. It will be a compelling product enough maybe to get three or five or 10X a year growth even when you're in the hundreds of billions of dollars which is extremely hard to do and has never been done in history before but not infinitely fast I, I buy that would be a slight slowdown. I- and maybe this is not your claim but sometimes people talk about this, like "Oh, the capabilities aren't there but because of diffusion " um, "otherwise, like, we're basically at AGI " and then- I, I, I don't believe we're basically at AGI. I think if you had the country of uh, geniuses in a data center, if your company didn't adopt the country of geniuses in a data center- If if you had the country of geniuses in a data center we would know it. Right, yeah. We would know it- Yes. . .. if you had the country- Yes. . .. of geniuses in a data center. Um- Like, everyone in this room would know it. Everyone in Washington would know it. Like, you know, people in rural, rural parts might not know it. Right. But, but, but, like, w- w- we would know it. I- we don't have that now. Th- that's very clear. (instrumental music) As Daria was hinting at, to get generalization you need to train across a wide variety of realistic tasks and environments. For example, with a sales agent, the hardest part isn't teaching it to mash buttons in a specific database in Salesforce. It's training the agent's judgment across ambiguous situations. How do you sort through a database with thousands of leads to figure out which ones are hot? How do you actually reach out? What do you do when you get ghosted? When an AI lab wanted to train a sales agent Label Box brought in dozens of Fortune 500 salespeople to build a bunch of different RL environments. They created thousands of scenarios where the sales agent had to engage with a potential customer which was role-played by a second AI. Label Box made sure that this customer AI had a few different personas because when you cold call, you have no idea who's gonna be on the other end. You need to be able to deal with a whole range of possibilities. Label Box's sales experts monitored these conversations turn by turn tweaking the role-playing agent to ensure it did the kinds of things an actual customer would do. Label Box could iterate faster than anybody else in the industry. This is super important because RL is an empirical science. It's not a solved problem. Label Box has a bunch of tools for monitoring agent performance in real time. This lets their experts keep coming up with tasks so that the model stays in the right distribution of difficulty and gets the optimal reward signal during training. Label Box can do this sort of thing in almost every domain. They've got hedge fund managers, radiologists, even airline pilots. So, whatever you're working on, Label Box can help.

Coming back to concrete predictions, because I think because there's so many different things to disami- ambiguate it can be easy to talk past each other when we're talking about capability. So, for example, when I interviewed you three years ago I asked you a prediction about what should we expect three years from now? And I think you were right. So, you said, "We should expect systems which if you talk to them for the course of an hour it's hard to tell them apart from-" Yes. ". .. a generally well-educated human. " Yes. And you were right about that. And I think spiritually I feel unsatisfied because my internal expectation was was that such a system could automate large parts of white-collar work. And so maybe more productive to talk about the actual end capabilities you want such a system- So so, I will, I will, I will basically tell you what what, you know, wh- wh- wh- where where I think we are. So- Let, let me, let me ask you then, a very specific question so that we can figure out exactly what kinds of capabilities you're thinking about Soon. So, maybe I'll ask about it in the context of a job I understand well not because it's the most relevant job, but um, just 'cause I can evaluate the claims about it. Um-Take video editors, right? I have video editors, and part of their invo- uh job involves learning about our audience's preferences, learning about my preferences and tastes and the different trade-offs we have and how uh, just over the course of many months building up this understanding of context. And so the skill and ability they have six months into the job a model that can pick up that skill on the job on the fly, when should we be expect such an AI system? Yeah, so I guess what you're talking about is like you know, we've, we're, we're doing this interview for three hours and then like you know, someone's gonna come in, someone's gonna edit it. They're gonna be like, "Oh, you know you know, I don't know, Dario, like you know, scratched his head and, you know we could, we could edit that out" and you know- Magnify that. (laughs) There was, there was this, like long, there was this, like, long discussion that like, is less interesting to people and then then, you know, then there's other thing that's like, more interesting to people. So, you know, let's, let's, let's kind of make this this edit. So, you know, I think the country geniuses in a data center wi- will be able to do that. The, the way it will be able to do that is you know, it will have general control of a computer screen right? Like, it, you know, and, and and you'll be able to feed this in and it'll be able also use the computer screen to like, go on the web, look at all your previous look at all your previous interviews, like look at what people are saying on Twitter in response to your interviews like, talk to you, ask you questions talk to your staff, look at the history of kind of edits edits that you did and from that, like do the job. Yeah. Um, so I think that's dependent on several things. One, that's dependent, and, and, and and I think this is one of the things that's actually blocking deployment um, getting to the point on computer use where the models are really masters at using the computer right? And, you know, we've seen this climb in in benchmarks, and benchmarks are always, you know imperfect measures, but like, you know, OS world is you know, went from, you know, like 5% acc- you know like, uh, I think when we first re- released you know, uh, uh, computer use like a a year and a quarter ago was like maybe 15%. I don't remember exactly. But we've climbed from that to like 65 or 70%. Um, and, and, you know, there may be harder measures as well but, but I think computer use has to pass a point of reliability. Can I just ask a follow-up on that- Yeah. . .. before you move onto the next point? Um, I often, for years, I've been uh, trying to build different internal LLM tools for myself and I of- often I have these text-in/text-out tasks which should be dead center in the repertoire of these models and yet I still hire humans to do them just because it's if it's something like make cli- f- identify what the best clips would be in this transcript and maybe they'll do like a seven out of ten job at them but there's not this ongoing way I can engage with them to help them get better at the job the way I could with a human employee. And so that missing ability, even if you saw computer use would still block my ability to, like offload an actual job to them. Again, there's, there's su- this gets back to what w- to to kinda, to kind of what, what we were talking about before- Yeah. . .. with learning on the job where it's, it's very interesting. You know, I think, I think with the coding agents like, I don't think people would say that learning on the job is what is what is, you know, preventing the coding agents from like, you know, doing everything end-to-end. Like, they keep, they keep getting better. We have engineers at Anthropic who, like don't write any code and when I look at the productivity to your, to your previous question, you know we have folks who say, "This, this GPU kernel this chip, I used to write it myself. I just have Claude do it. " And so there's this, there's this enormous improvement in productivity and I don't know like, when I see Claude code, like familiarity with the code base or like, it w- you know or, or a feeling that the model hasn't worked at the company for for a year, that's not high up on the list of complaints I see. And so I think what I'm saying is we're we're like, we're kind of taking a different path. But don't, don't, don't you think with coding that's because there is an external scaffold of memory which exists instantiated in the code base which I don't know how many other jobs have. .. Coding made fast progress preci- precisely because it has this unique um, advantage that other- But, but- . .. economic activity doesn't. But, but when you say that, what you're what you're implying is that by reading the code base into the context I have everything that the human needed to learn on the job. So that would be an example of whether it's written or not whether it's available or not, a case where everything you needed to know you got from the context window, right? And that, and that what we think of as learning like, "Oh, man, I started this job. It's gonna take me six months to understand the code base " the model just did it in the context. Yeah, I, I honestly don't know how to think about this because th- there there are people who qualitative report what you're saying. Um, there was, uh, Meter study I'm sure you saw last year- Yes. . .. where they had experienced developers try to close uh, pull requests in repositories that they were familiar with and those developers reported an uplift. They, they reported that they felt more productive with the use of these models but in fact, if you look at their output and how much was actually merged back in there's a 20% down lift. They were less productive as a result of using the models. And so I'm trying to square the qualitative feeling that people feel with these models versus um, one, in a macro level, where are all the where is this, like, renaissance of software? And two, when people do these independent evaluations wh- why are we not seeing the, um- Yeah so- . .. qualitative benefits that we would expect? . .. within Anthropic, this is just really unambiguous right? We're under an incredible amount of commercial pressure and make it even hard harder for ourselves 'cause we have all this safety stuff we do that I think we do more than than, than other companies. So like, the, the, the pressure to survive economically while also keeping our values is is just incredible, right? We're trying to keep this 10X revenue curve going. There's like, there is zero time for bullshit. There is zero time for feeling like we're productive when we're not. Like, these tools make us a lot more productive. Like, why, why do you think we're concerned about competitors using the tools? Because we think we're ahead of the competitors and like w- we don't, we don't want to excel. We, we, we, we wouldn't be going through all this trouble if this was secretly reducing reducing our productivity. Like, we see the end productivity every few months in the form of model launches. Like, there's no kidding yourself about this. Like, the models make you more productive. One, that i- uh, people feeling like they're more productive is qualitatively predicted by studies like this. But two, if I just look at the end output obviously you guys are making fast progress. But the fact, you know, the- the- the- the idea was supposed to be wi- with recursive self-improvement is that you make a better AI the AI helps you build a be- a better next AI et cetera, et cetera. Yes. And what I see instead, if I look at the you OpenAI, DeepMind, is that people are just shifting around the podium every few months. And maybe you think that stops 'cause you've- you've won or whatever but, um, but why- why are we not seeing the person with the best coding model have this lasting advantage if, in fact, there are these enormous productivity gains from the last coding model? Yeah, so, so, no, no, no. I- I- I mean, I mean, I mean I think it's all like. .. My- my model of the situation is there's- there's an advantage that's gradually growing. Like I would say right now, the coding models give maybe I don't know, a- a, like, 15% maybe 20% total factor speed up. Like that's my view. Um, uh, and six months ago, it was maybe 5%. And so- and so it didn't matter. Like 5% doesn't register. It's now just getting to the point where it's like one of several factors that- that kind of matters and- and that's gonna- that's gonna keep speeding up. And so I think six months ago, like you know, th- there were several- there were several companies that were at roughly the same point because uh, you know, this- this wasn't, uh- this wasn't a notable factor. But I think it's starting to speed up more and more. I- you know, I- I would- I would also say there are multiple companies that you know, write models that are used for code and, you know, we're not perfectly good at you know, preventing some of these other companies from- from- from using- from- from- from kind of using our models internally. Um, so, uh, you know, I think- I think everything we're s- uh e- kind of kind of everything we're seeing is consistent with this kind of um, this kind of snowball model, where y- where you know, there's no hard. .. Again, my- my- my- my- my theme in all of this is like all of this is soft takeoff, like soft smooth exponentials, although the exponentials are relatively steep. And so- and so we're seeing this snowball gather momentum where it's like 10% 20%, 25%, you know, for- f- for- 40%. And as you go, yeah, Amdahl's law you have to get all the, like things that are preventing you from cr- from closing the loop out of the way. Stepping back, I think before in the stack we were talking about, um, well, when do we get this on-the-job learning and it seems like the coding- y- the point you were making with the coding thing is we actually don't need on-the-job learning, uh that you can have tremendous productivity improvements, you can have potentially trillions of dollars of revenue for AI companies without this basic human ability n- uh, maybe that's not your claim. You should clarify. Um, but without this basic human ability to learn on the job. But I- I just look at it, like in- in- in most domains of economic activity people say, "I hired somebody. They weren't that useful for the first few months and then over time, they built up the context understanding. " It's actually hard to define what we're talking about here. But they- they got something, and then now- now they're- they're a power horse, and they're so valuable to us. And if AI doesn't develop this ability to learn on the fly I'm not. .. I- I'm a bit skeptical that we're gonna see huge changes to the world with- without that ability. Yeah, so I think- I think- I think two things here right? There's the state of the technology right now um, which is again, we have these two stages. We have the pre-training and RL stage where you throw- you throw a bunch of data and tasks into the models and then they generalize. So it's like learning, but it's like learning from more data and- and not you know, not learning over kind of one human or one model's lifetime. So again, this is situated between evolution and- and- and- and human learning. But once you learn all those skills, you have 'em. And- and just like with pre-training, just how the models know more. .. You know, if- if I look at a- a pretrained model you know, it knows more about the history of samurai in Japan than I do. It knows more about baseball than I do. It knows, you know, it knows more about low pass filters and electronics than. .. You know, all- all- all of these things. Its knowledge is way broader than mine. So I think- I think even- even just that um, you know, may get us to the point where the models are better at uh, m- m- you know, kind of better at everything. And then we also have, again, just with scaling the kind of existing setup we have the in-context learning, which I would describe as kind of like human on-the-job learning but like a little weaker and a little short term. Like you look at in-context learning, the- y- you give the model a bunch of examples. It does get it. There's real learning that happens in context. And like, a million tokens is a lot. That's- that's, you know, that can be days of human learning right? You know, if you think about the model you know, r- r- you know, kind of read- reading- reading a million words you know, it- it, you know, takes me. .. How long would it take me to read a million. .. I mean, you know, like days or weeks at least. Um, uh, so you have these two things and- and I think these two- these two things within the existing paradigm may just be enough to get you the country of geniuses in the data center. I don't know for sure, but I think they're gonna get you a large fraction of it. There may be gaps, but I- I certainly think just as things are, this, I believe is enough to generate trillions of dollars of revenue. That's one. That's all one. Two is this idea of continual learning, this idea of a single model learning on the job. Um, I think we're working on that too and I think there's a good chance that in the next year or two we also make, we also solve that. Um, I- I, again, I- I- I you know, I think you get most of the way thereWithout it I think the trillions of dollars of, of you know, the, the, I think the trillions of dollars a year market maybe all of the national security implications and the safety implications that I wrote about in Adolescence of Technology can happen without it. But I, I, I also think we and I imagine others, are working on it and I think there's a good chance that that, you know, that we get there within the next year or two. There are a bunch of ideas. I won't go into all of them in detail but, um, you know, one is just make the context longer. There's, there's nothing preventing longer context from working. You just have to train at longer context and then learn to to serve them at inference, and both of those are engineering problems that we are working on and that I would assume others are working on as well. Yeah, so this context length increase, it seemed like there was a period from 2020 to 2023 where from GPT-3 to GPT-4 Turbo there was an increase from like 2,000 context lengths to 128K. I feel like for the next, for the two-ish years since then we've been in the same-ish ballpark. Yeah. And when model context lengths get much longer than that people report qualitative degradation in the ability of the model to consider that full context. Um, so I'm curious what you're internally seeing that makes you think like, oh, 10 million contexts, 100 million contexts to get human, like- Yeah, thi- this isn't this isn't- . .. six months learning billion, billion contexts. . .. this isn't a research problem. This is a, this is an engineering and inference problem. Mm-hmm. Right? If you wanna serve long contexts, you have to like, store your entire KV cache. You have to- Yeah. . .. you know, um, uh, you know it's, it's, it's difficult to store all of the memory in the GPUs to juggle the memory around, I don't even know the detail you know, uh, uh, at this point this is at a level of detail that that, that I'm no longer able to follow although, you know, I, I knew it in the GPT-3 era of like, you know, these are the weights these are the activations- Yeah. . .. you have to store. Um, uh, but, you know, you know these days the whole thing has flipped 'cause we have MoE models and and, and kind of all of that. But, um, uh, and, and this degradation you're talking about like, again, without getting too specific, like a question I would ask is, like there's two things. There's the context length you train at, and there's the context length that you serve at. If you train at a small context length- Mm-hmm. . .. and then try to serve at a long context length like, maybe you get these degradations. It's better than nothing. You might still lose it, but you get these degradations. And maybe it's harder to train at a long context length. So, you know, there's, there's a lot. I, I, I wanna at the same time ask about like, m- maybe some rabbit holes of like, wouldn't you expect that if you had to train on longer context length that would mean that, um, you're able to get sort of like, less samples in for the same amount of compute? But before, maybe it's not worth diving deep on that. I, I wanna get an answer to the bigger picture question which is, like, okay, so, um I don't feel a preference for a human editor that's been working for me for six months versus an AI that's been working w- with me for six months. What year do you predict that that will be the case? I, my, I mean, you know m- m- my guess for that is, you know there, there's a lot of problems that are basically like, we can do this when we have the country of geniuses in a data center. Um, and so, you know, my my, my, my picture for that is you know, again, if you, if you if you, if, you know, if you made me guess it's like one to two years, maybe one to three years. It's really hard to tell. I have a, I have a strong view 99, 95% that like all this will happen in 10 years. Like, that's, I think that's just a super safe bet. Yeah. And then I have a hunch, this is more like a 50/50 thing that it's gonna be more like one to two maybe more like one to three. So one to three years. Country of geniuses, um, and a slightly less economically valuable task of editing videos. (laughs) I, I, it seems pretty economically valuable let me tell you. It's just there are a lot of use cases like that. That's right. Exactly, yeah. There are a lot of similar ones. Exactly. So you're predicting that within one to three years. Um, and then generally Anthropic has predicted that by late '26 early '27, we will have AI systems that are quote, "Um, have the ability to navigate interfaces available to humans doing digital work today intellectual capabilities matching or exceeding that of Nobel Prize winners and the ability to interface with the physical world. " And then you gave an interview two months ago with DealBook where you were emphasizing your um, your company's more responsible compute scaling as compared to your competitor's. And I'm trying to square these two views where if you really believe that we're gonna have a country of geniuses you, you want as big a data center as you can get. There's no reason to slow down. The TAM of a Nobel Prize winner that is actually can do everything a Nobel Prize winner can do is, like, trillions of dollars. And so I'm trying to square this conservatism uh, which seems rational if you have more moderate timelines with your stated views about AI progress. Yeah, so, so it actually all fits together. And, and we go back to this fast but not infinitely fast diffusion. So, like, let's say that we're making progress at this rate. Um, you know, the, the, the technology is making progress this fast. Again, I have, you know, very high conviction that like, it's going, you know, the the, (laughs) you know, we're, we're we're gonna get there within, within a few years. I have a hunch that we're gonna get there within a year or two. So a, a little uncertainty on the technical side but, like, you know, pretty, pretty strong confidence that it won't be off by much. What I'm less certain about is, again the economic diffusion side. Like, I really do believe that we could have models that are a country of geniuses a hun- country of geniuses in a data center in one to two years. One question is, how many years after that do the trillions in you know, do, do, do the trillions in revenue start rolling in? Um, I don't think it's guaranteed that it's going to be immediate. Um, you know, I think it could be um, one year. It could be two years. I could even stretch it to five years although I'm, like, I'm skeptical of that. And so we have this uncertainty which is even if the technology goes as fast as I suspect that it will-We we don't know exactly how fast it's gonna drive revenue. We, we know it's coming, but with the way you buy these data centers if you're off by a couple years, that can be ruinous. It is just like how I wrote, you know in Machines of Love & Grace, I said "Look, I think we might get this powerful AI this country of genius in the data center. " That description you gave comes from the machines of loving grace. I said we'll get that 2026, maybe 2027 again. That is, that is my hunch. Wouldn't be surprised if I'm off by a year or two but, like, that is my hunch. Let's say that happens, that's the starting gun how long does it take to cure all the diseases right? That's, that's one of the ways that like, drives a huge amount of, of of economic value, right? Like, you cure, you cure every disease you know, there's a question of how much of that goes to the pharmaceutical company to the AI company, but there's an enormous consumer surplus because everyone you know, ev- ev- assuming we can get access for everyone which I care about greatly, we, you know we, we cure all of these diseases. How long does it take? You have to do the biological discovery, you have to you know, go, you have to, you know m- m- manufacture the new drug, you have to you know, go through the regulatory pro. .. I mean, we saw this with, like vaccines and COVID, right? Like, it, th- th- there's just this we, we got the vaccine out to everyone but it took a year and a half right? And, and so my question is, how long does it take to get the cure for everything which AI is the genius that can, in theory invent, out to everyone? How long from when that AI first exists in the lab to when diseases have actually been cured for everyone right? In, in, w- w- you know, we've had a polio vaccine for 50 years we're still trying to eradicate it in the most remote corners of Africa. And, you know, the Gates Foundation is trying as hard as they can others are trying as hard as they can but, you know, that's difficult. A- again, I, you know, I don't expect most of the economic diffusion to be as difficult as that right? That's, like, the most difficult case. But, but there's a, there's a real dilemma here. And, and where I've settled on it is it will be f- it will be a it will be faster than anything we've seen in the world but it still has its limits. And, and so then when we go to buying data centers you know, you, a- again, again the curve I'm looking at is, okay we, you know, we've had a 10X a year increase every year. So beginning of this year, we're looking at 10 billion in in, in annual, in, you know rate of annualized revenue at the beginning of the year. We have to decide how much compute to buy. Um, and, you know, it takes a year or two to actually build out the data centers to reserve the data centers, so basically I'm saying like, in, uh, 2027, how much compute do I get? Well, I could assume, um, uh that, uh, the, uh, revenue will continue growing 10X a year so it'll be, uh, one, uh one, uh, 100 billion at the end of 2026 and 1 trillion at the end of 2027. And so I could buy a trillion dollars actually it would be like $5 trillion of compute because it would be a trillion dollar a year for for five years, right? I could buy $1 trillion of compute that starts at the end of 2027. And if my, if my revenue is not $1 trillion if it's even 800 billion, there's no force on Earth there's, there's no hedge on Earth that could stop me from going bankrupt if I if I buy that much compute And, and so even though a part of my brain wonders if it's gonna keep growing 10X I, I can't buy $1 trillion a year of compute in in, in, in, in, in, in in, in, in, in 2027. Uh, if I'm just off by a year in that rate of growth or if the the growth rate is 5X a year instead of 10X a year then, then, you know, (laughs) then then you go bankrupt (laughs) Um, and and, a- a- and so you end up in a world where you know, you're supporting hundreds of billions not trillions, and you accept s- you accept some risk that there's so much demand that you can't support the revenue. And you accept still some risk that, you know you got it wrong and it's still slow. And so when I talked about behaving responsibly what I meant actually was not the absolute amount. That, that actually was not, um. .. You know, I, I think it is true we're spending somewhat less than some of the other players. It's actually the other things, like, have we been thoughtful about it or are we YOLOing and saying "Oh, we're gonna do $100 billion here or $100 billion there. " I kinda get the impression that, you know some of the other companies have not written down the spreadsheet that they don't really understand the risks they're taking. They're just kinda doing stuff 'cause it sounds cool. Um, uh, and, and we've thought carefully about it right? We're an enterprise business, therefore, you know we can rely more on revenue. It's less fickle than consumer. We have better margins, which is the buffer between buying too much and buying too little. And so I think we bought an amount that allows us to capture pretty strong upside worlds. It won't capture the full 10X a year. Um, and things would have to go pretty badly for us to be for us to be in financial trouble. So I think we've thought carefully and we've made that balance and and that's what I mean when I say that we're being responsible. Okay. So it seems like, um, it's possible that we're a- we actually just have different definitions of a country of genius and a data center. Because when I think of, like, actual human geniuses an actual country of human geniuses and a data center I'm like, eh, I, I would happily buy $5 trillion worth of compute to run an actual country of human geniuses and a data center. So let's say JP Morgan or Moderna or whatever doesn't wanna use them. Also, I've got a country of geniuses like, they'll, they'll start their own company. Absolutely. Absolutely. And if, like, they, they can't start their own company and they're bottlenecked by clinical trials it is worth stating with clinical trials, like most clinical trials fail because the drug doesn't work there's no efficacy, right? And, and I make exactly that point- Right. . .. in, in Machines of Love & Grace. I say the clinical trials are gonna go much faster than we're used to- But but- . .. but not, not instant, not infinitely fast. A- a- and then suppose it takes a year to uh, for the clinical trials to work out so that you're getting revenue from that and can make more drugs okay, well, you've got a country of geniuses and you're an AI lab and you have (laughs) you could use, uh, many more AI researchers um, you also think that there's these like, self-reinforcing gains from, uh, you know smart people working on AI tech. So, like, okay, you can have the- That's right but- . .. you can have the data center working on like, AI progress- Is there more gains from buying-. .. like, substantially more gains from buying a trillion dollars a year of compute versus $300 billion a year of compute. If your competitor's buying a trillion, yes there is. (laughs) Well, th- no, there's some gain but then but a- again, the- there's this chance that they go bankrupt before uh, y- you know, bef- uh, uh again, if you're off by only a year you destroy yourselves. That's the, that's the balance. We're buying a lot. We're buying a hell of a lot. Like, we're not, we're, we're, you know we're buying a, a amount that's comparable to that that, you know, the, the, the the, the, the biggest players in the game are buying. Um, but, but if you're asking me why why haven't we signed, you know, 10 10 trillion of compute starting in, starting in mid-2027 first of all, it can't be produced. There isn't that much in the world. Um, uh, but, but second, um what if the Country of Geniuses comes, but it comes in mid-2028 instead of mid-2027? You go bankrupt. So, if your projection is one to three years it seems like you should want $10 trillion of compute by um, 2029? 2020, uh, maybe 2025 latest. I mean- Like, uh, I mean, you know y- you- But like are you sure? Like, i- it seems like even in your l- the longest version of the timelines you state the compute you are ramping up to build doesn't seem- What what, wh- . .. in accordance- What, what makes you think that? Well, you, you, as you said you, you want the $10 trillion . .. Like human wages, let's say, are, um on the order of $50 trillion a year. If y- And then- If you look at like . .. So, so I won't, I won't talk about Anthropic in particular but if you talk about the industry, like um, the amount of compute the industry ha- you know the, the, the amount of compute the industry's building this year is probably in the you know, I don't know, very low tens of m- ma- you know, call it 10 15 gigawatts. Next year, I, you know, it b- it goes up by roughly 3X a year so like next year's 30 or 40 gigawatts and, um, 2028 might be 100, 2029 might be like three- 300 gigawatts and like each gigawatt costs like, um maybe 10. .. I mean, I'm doing the math in my head but each gigawatt i- costs maybe $10 billion you know, o- of the order of $10 to $15 billion a year. So, you know, you, you kind of you, you, you know, you put that all together a- and you're getting about about what you described. You're getting multiple trillions a year by 2028 or 2029. So you're, you're, you're getting exactly that. You're getting, you're getting exactly what you predict. Um, that's for the industry. That, that's for the industry, that's right. So, suppose Anthropic's compute keeps 3Xing a year and then by like '27 you have, uh or '27, '28 you have 10 gigawatts. And a l- l- like multiply that by as you say, um, 10 billion, so then it's like 100 billion a year. But then you were saying the TAM by 2028 '29- Again, I, I, I don't want to give exact numbers for Anthropic but, but these numbers are too small. These numbers are too small. Okay, interesting. I'm really proud that the puzzles I've worked on with Jane Street have resulted in them hiring a bunch of people from my audience. Well, they're still hiring, and they just sent me another puzzle. For this one, they spent about 20 000 GPU hours training backdoors into three different language models. Each one has a hidden prompt that elicits completely different behavior. You just have to find the trigger. This is particularly cool because finding backdoors is actually an open question in frontier AI research. Anthropic actually released a couple of papers about sleeper agents and they showed that you can build a simple classifier on the residual stream to detect when a backdoor is about to fire. But they already knew what the triggers were because they built them. You're, you don't, and it's not feasible to check the activations for all possible trigger phrases. Unlike the other puzzles they made for this podcast Jane Street isn't even sure this one is solvable but they've set aside $50,000 for the best attempts and write-ups. The puzzle's live at janestreet. com/tarkesh, and they're accepting submissions until April 1st. All right, back to Dario. You've told investors that you plan to be profitable starting in '28 and this is the year where we're like potentially getting the Country of Geniuses as a data center and w- you know, this is like gonna now unlock all this uh, progress in, uh, medicine, and uh, health, and et cetera, et cetera and new technologies. I- wouldn't this be a particu- the, the exactly the time where you'd like want to reinvest in the business and build bigger countries so they can make more discoveries? Yeah, so, so, I mean, profited profitability is this kind of like weird thing in this field. I, I, like, like I don't think I, I don't think in this field profitability is actually a measure of uh, um, you know, kind of spending down versus investing in the business. Like, let's, let's just, let's just take a model of this. I actually think profitability happens when you underestimated the amount of demand you were gonna get and loss happens when you overestimated the amount of demand you were going to get um, because you're buying the data centers ahead of time. So, think about it this way. Um, ideally, you would like . .. A- and again, these are stylized facts. These numbers are not exact for Anthr- I- I'm just trying to make a toy model here. Let's say half of your compute is for training and half of your compute is for inference. Um, and you know, the inference has some gross margin that's like more than 50%. Um, and so what that means is that if you were in steady state you build a data center, if you knew exactly exactly, exactly the demand you were getting you would, um, uh, uh, uh you know, y- y- you would, you would you w- you would, you would get a certain amount of revenue say, I don't know, uh, uh let's say you pay $100 billion a year for compute and on $50 billion a year you support $150 billion on of, of, of, of, of, of of revenue, and the other 50 billion the other 50 billion are used for training. Um, so basically you're profitable, you make fi- you make fi- you make $50 billion of profit. Those are the economics of the industry today. Or, or sorry, not today, but like that's where we're projecting forward in a year or two. The only thing that makes that not the case is if you get-Less demand than 50 billion um, then you have more than 50% of your your data center for research, and you're not profitable. So you, you know, you train stronger models but you're like not profitable. Um, if you, uh, get more demand than you thought then your research gets squeezed, um, but uh, you know, you're, you're, you're kind of able to support more inference and you're more profitable. So it's, uh, maybe I'm not explaining it well but, but the thing I'm trying to say is you decide the amount of compute first, and then you have some target desire of of inference versus, versus training. But that gets determined by demand. It doesn't get determined by you. W- what I'm hearing is the reason you're predicting profit is that you are systematically underestimate uh, uh, underinvesting in compute, right? Because if you actually like- (laughs) No, no no, no, no. I'm saying, I'm saying it's hard to predict. So, so these things about 2028 and when it will happen that's our, that's our attempt to do the best we can with investors. All of this stuff is really uncertain because of the cone of uncertainty. Like, we could be profitable in 2026 if the if the revenue grows fast enough and then and then, um, uh, you know if we, if we overestimate or underestimate the next year that could swing wildly. Like I, I, I. .. What I'm trying to get at is you have a model in your head of like the the business invests, invests, invests, invests gets scale and, and, and, and kind of then becomes profitable. There's a single point at which things turn around. I don't think the economics of this industry work that way. I see. So, uh, if I'm understanding correctly, you're saying because of the discrepancy between the amount of compute we should have gotten and the amount of compute we got we, we were like sort of forced to make profit but that, that doesn't mean we're gonna continue making profit. We're gonna like reinvest the money because, well now AI has made so much progress and we want the bigger country of geniuses. And so then back into, uh- No no, no. If we- . .. revenue is high, but losses are also high. If we, if we, if we predict. .. If every year we predict exactly what the demand is going to be we'll be profitable every year because grow. .. because spending, spending 50% of your compute on on, um, 50% of your compute on research roughly um, plus a gross margin that's higher than 50% and and correct demand prediction leads to profit. That's the prof- that's, that's the profitable business model that I think is kind of like there but like obs- obscured by these, like building ahead and prediction errors. I, I guess you're treating the 50% as a uh, as a sort of like, uh uh, you know, just like a given constant. Yes. Yes. Whereas you. .. In fact, if you, if AI progress is fast and you can increase the progress by scaling up more you should just have more than 50%- Well- . .. percent and not make profit. . .. here's what I'll say. You might wanna scale up it more. You might wanna scale it up more, but but, but, you know, remember the log returns to scale right? If, if 70% would get you a a, a, a very little bit of a smaller model through a factor of of 1. 4X, right? Like that extra $20 billion is, is is, is you know, that each, each dollar there is worth much less to you because of because, because the log linear setup. And so you might find that it's better to invest that that, that, that. .. It's better to invest that $20 billion in you know, in, in serving inference or in hiring engineers who are who are, who are kind of better who are, who are kind of better who are kind of better at what they're doing. So the, the reason I said 50% that's not, that's not exactly our target. It's not exactly gonna be 50%. It'll probably vary, vary over time. What, what I'm saying is the, the the, the, the like log linear return what it leads to is you spend of order one fraction of the business right? Like not five percent, not 95%. And then it, then it, then, you know then, then, then you get diminishing returns because the because the log, log, log scale off- I I feel strange that I'm like convincing Dario- But but- . .. to like believe in AI progress or something. But like, uh, you. .. Okay, you, you don't invest in research because it has diminishing returns but you invest in the other things you mentioned. Again, again, we're talking about diminishing returns a- after you're spending 50 billion a year right? Like- Um, this is a point I'm I'm sure you would make, but like diminishing returns on a genius is could be quite high. And more generally, like what is profit in a market economy? Profit is basically saying the- Well, th- . .. other companies in the market can like do more but more things with this money than I can. So yeah. And, and put aside Anthropic. I'm just trying to like. .. 'cause I, you know, I don't want to give information about Anthropic. It's why I'm giving these stylized numbers. But like, let's just derive the equilibrium of the industry right? I think the e- so, so, so why doesn't everyone spend 100% of their um, uh, you know, 100% of their compute on training and not serve any customers right? It's because if they didn't get any revenue they couldn't raise money, they couldn't do compute deals they couldn't buy more compute the next year. So there's gonna be an equilibrium where every every company spends less than 100% on, on on, on, on training and certainly less than 100% on inference. It should be clear why you don't just serve the current models and and, you know, and, and, a- a- and and never train another model because then you don't have any demand because you'll because you'll fall behind. So there's some equilibrium. It's, it's not gonna be 10%. It's not gonna be 90%. Let's just say as a stylized fact, it's 50%. That's what I'm getting at. And, and, and I think we're gonna be in a position where that equilibrium of how much you spend on training is less than the gross margins that that you're, that, that, that you're able to get on compute. And so the, the, the, the underlying economics are profitable. The problem is you have this, this hellish demand prediction problem when you're when you're buying the next year of compute and you might guess under and be very profitable but have no compute for research, or you might guess over and you know, you're, you're, you're, um uh, you, you are not profitable and you have all the compute c- compute for research in the world. Does, does, does that make sense just as a dynamic model of the industry? Yeah. May- maybe stepping back, I'm like, uh I, I, I'm not saying I, I think the country of geniuses is gonna come in two years and therefore you should buy this compute. Um, to me, what you're saying, the end conclusion you're arriving at makes a lot of sense. But-. .. uh, that's because, like, oh, it seems like Country of Geniuses is hard and there's a long way to go. And so the stepping back, the thing I'm trying to get at is more like it seems like your worldview is compatible with somebody who says "Ah, we're, like, 10 years away from a world- Yeah. . .. in which, like, we're generating trillions of dollars worth-" And and that's, and that's, and that's just that's just not my view. Yeah. That is, that is not my view. Like, I, I s- so, so I'll like, I'll, like, make another prediction. It is hard for me to see that that there won't be trillions of dollars in revenue before 2030. Hmm. Um, like, uh, I c- I c- can construct a plausible world it takes maybe three years, so that w- that w- you know that would be the end of what I think it's plausible. Like, in 2028, we get the, the real Country of Geniuses in a data center. You know, the revenue's been, been goi- you know the revenue's been going into the, maybe is i- is in the low hundreds of billions by by, by, by 2028. And, and, and then the Country of Geniuses accelerates it to trillions you know, and, and w- we're basically we're basically on the slow end of diffusion. It takes two years to get to the trillions. Ah. That, that, that would, that, that that would be the world where it takes until that would be the world where it takes until 2030. I, I, I suspect even composing the technical exponential and diffusion exponential we'll get there before 2030. Uh, so you laid out a model where Anthropic makes profit because it seems like fundamentally, we're in a compute-constrained world and so it's like, eventually, we keep growing compute- No I think, I think the way the profit comes is a- a- again, and, and, and you know, let's, let's just abstract to- Yeah. . .. the whole industry here. Like, we have a, you know, let's just imagine we're we're, we're in, like, an economics textbook. Right. We have a small number of firms. Each can invest a limited amount in, you know or, or, or, like, each can invest some frac- fraction in R&D. They have some marginal cost to serve. The margins on that m- the profit marg- the gross profit margins on that marginal cost are like, very high because, because, because inference is efficient. There's some competition, but the models are also differentiated. There's some, there's some, um, you know companies will compete to push their research budgets up but like, because there's a small number of players you know, we have the, uh, what is it called in econ- the Cournot equilibrium I think is what the, what the uh, small number of firm equili- equilibrium is. It, th- the point is, it, it doesn't equilibrate to perfect competition with with, with, with, with, with, with zero margins. If there's, like, three firms, if there's three firms in the economy all are kind of independently behaving, behaving rationally it doesn't equilibrate to zero. Um, he- help me understand that, 'cause right now we do have three leading firms and they're not making profit. Yeah. Um, and so what, what, w- uh yeah, what, what is changing? Yeah. So the, the, again, the gross margins right now are very positive. What's happ- what, what, what's happening is a combination of two things. One is we're still in the exponential scale-up phase of compute. Yeah. Um, so what basically what that means is we're training like, a model gets trained. Yeah. It costs, you know, let's say a model got trained that costs uh, a billion dollars last year. Um, and then, uh, this year it produced, uh, four billion dollars of revenue and cost $1 billion to to, uh, to, to, to inference from. Um, so, you know, again, I'm using a stylized number here but you know, that would be 75% you know, gross, gross, gross margins and you know, this, this 25% tax. So that model as a whole makes $2 billion. Um, but at the same time, we're spending $10 billion to train the next model because there's an exponential scale-up. And so the company loses money. Each model makes money, but the company loses money. The equilibrium I'm talking about is an equilibrium where we have the Country of Geniuses we have the Country of Geniuses in a data center but that, that, um, model training scale-up has equilibrated more. Maybe, maybe it's still, it's still going up we're still trying to predict the demand, but it's more it's more, um, leveled out. Um, I, I'm confused on a couple things there. So, um, let's start with the current world. Um, in the current world, you're right that as you s- said before, if you treat each individual model as a company it's profitable. Yes. But of course, a big part of the production function of being a Frontier lab is training the next model right? So- Yes, that's right. . .. if, if you didn't do that, then you'd make profit for two months. That's right. That's right. And then you wouldn't have margins 'cause you wouldn't have the best model. And then, so yeah, you, you can make profits for two months on the current system. Right, but at, at some point, that reaches the biggest scale that it can reach and then, and then in equilibrium, we have algorithmic improvements but we're spending roughly the same amount to train the next model as as, as, as we spent to train the current model. Um, so this equilibrium relies- I mean at some point, at som- at s- at some point you run out of money in the economy. Uh, a, a fixed lump of labor follows. Eh, the economy's gonna grow, right? That's one of your predictions. Well, yes, but this is, this this- We're gonna have, data centers in space. But this is another example of the theme I was talking about which is that the economy will grow much faster with AI than I think it ever has before but it's not, like right now, the compute is growing 3X a year. Yeah. I don't believe the economy is gonna grow 300% a year. Like, I said this in Machines of Love and Grace. Like, I think we, we may get 10 or 20% per year growth in the economy but we're not gonna get 300% growth in the economy. So- So I think, I think in the end you know, com- c- if, if compute becomes the majority of what the economy produces it's, it's gon- it's gonna be capped by that. So lets, uh, okay, now let's assume a model where compute stays capped. Yeah. Um, the world where Frontier labs are making money is one where they continue to make um, fast progress, because fundamentally, your margin is limited by how good the alternative is. And so you are able to make money 'cause you have a Frontier model. Um, if you didn't have a Frontier model you wouldn't be making money. Well, you, you, I mean- And and so th- th- this, this model requires there never to be a steady state. That, that, that actually- Like forever and ever you keep making- No, I don't- . .. more algorithmic progress. I don't think that's true. I mean, I, I f- I feel I feel like we're, we're, like, we're ta- we're we're, you know, we're, uh, I feel like this is an economics uh- (laughs) . .. like, uh, you know, th- this is this is like an economics class now or something. Do you know the Tyler Cowen quote? "W- we never stop talking about economics. " (laughs) We never, we never stop talking about economics. So, no, but, but there, there are there are worlds in which, uh-Um, you know there, the, w- so I, I don't think this field's gonna be a m- th- I don't think this field's gonna be a monopoly. All my lawyers never want me to say the word monopoly. (laughs) Um, but, uh, I don't think this field's gonna be a monopoly. But, but you do get, you get industries in which there are a small number of players. Not one, but a small number of players. And ordinarily, like, the, the way you get monopolies like Facebook or or Meta, or, I, I always call them Facebook but, um, uh, uh, is, is these kind of net- is these kind of these kind of network effects. Yeah. The way you get industries in which there are a small number of players are very high costs of entry right? Um, so, you know, uh, cloud is like this. I think cloud is a good example of this. You have three, maybe four players within cloud. I think, I think that's the same for AI. Three, maybe four. Um, uh, and the reason is that it's it's so expensive, it requires so much expertise and so much capital to like, run a cloud company, right? And so you have to put up all this capital and then in addition to putting up all this capital you have to get all of this other stuff that like, you know, requires a lot of skill to you know, to make it happen. And so it's like, if you go to someone and you're like "I want to disrupt this industry. Here's $100 billion. " You're like, "Okay, I'm putting in $100 billion and also betting that you can do all these other things that these people have been doing for like-" Only to decrease the profit in the industry. Yeah, yeah, and, and then, and then the effect of your entering is th- is the profit margins go down. So, you know, we have equilibria like this all the time in the economy where we have a few, we have a few players profits are not astronomical, margins are not astronomical but they're, they're not zero, right? Um, uh, and, and, you know I think, I think that's what we see on cloud. Cloud is very undifferentiated. Models are more differentiated than cloud, right? Like, everyone knows Claude is, Claude, Claude is good at different things than GPT is good at is, than, than Gemini is good at. And it's not just Claude's good at coding GPT is good at, you know, math and reasoning you know. Um, uh, it, it's more subtle than that. Like, models are good at different types of coding. Models have different styles. Like, I think, I think these things are actually you know, quite different from each other and so I would expect more differentiation than you see in in, um, cloud. Now, there, there actually is a, uh counter, there, there, there is one counterargument. Um, and that counterargument is that if all of that the process of producing models, um, becomes uh, if AI models can do that themselves then that could spread throughout the economy. But that is not an argument for commoditizing AI models in general. That's kind of an argument for commoditizing the whole economy at once. Um, I don't know what, what quite happens in that world where basically anyone can do anything anyone can build anything, and there's, like no moat around anything at all. I mean, I don't know, maybe we want that world. Like, like, maybe that's the, maybe that's the end state here. Like, maybe, maybe, um, you know when w- maybe when, when, when kind of AI models can do m- m- you know when, when, when, when AI models can do everything if we've solved all the safety and security problems like, you know, that's one of the one of the, one of the mechanisms for for, uh, you know, um, uh uh, you know, just, just kind of the economy flattening itself again. But, but that's kind of like post like, (laughs) far post Country of Geniuses in a data center. Um, uh, may- maybe, uh, a finer way to put that uh, potential point is one, um, it seems like AI research is especially loaded on raw intellectual power which will be especially abundant in a world with AGI. And two, if you just look at the world today there's very few technologies that seem to be diffusing as fast as um, as AI algorithmic progress. And so that does hint that this industry is sort of structurally d- diffusive. So I think coding is going fast, but I think AI research is a superset of coding and there are aspects of it that are not going fast. Um, uh, but I, but I do think again, once we get coding, once we get AI models going fast then, you know, AI, you know that will speed up the ability of AI models to kind of to kind of do everything else. So I think while coding is going fast now I think once the AI models are building the next AI models and building everything else the kind of whole, the whole economy will start to kind of go at the same pace. Hmm. I am, I am worried geographically though. I'm a little worried that, like, just proximity to AI having heard about AI, um, uh, that that that may be one differentiator. And so when I said the, like you know, 10 or 20% growth rate a worry I have is that the growth rate could be like 50% in Silicon Valley and you know, parts of the world that are kind of socially connected to Silicon Valley and you know, not that much faster than its current pace elsewhere. And I think that'd be a pretty messed up world. So I, one of the things I think about a lot is how to prevent that. Yeah. Do you think that once we have, uh this Country of Geniuses in a data center that robotics is sort of quickly solved afterwards? Because it seems like a big problem with robotics is that um, a human can learn how to tele-operate current hardware but current AI models can't. At least not, not in a way that's super productive. And so if we have this ability to learn like a human should it solve for robotics immediately as well? Yeah. I don't think it's dependent on learning like a human. It could happen in different ways. Again, we could have trained the model on many different video games which are like robotic controls, or many different simulated robotics environments or just, you know, train them to control computer screens and they learn to generalize. So it will happen, i- i- it's not necessarily dependent on human-like learning. Human-like learning is one way it could happen. If the model's like, "Oh, I pick up a robot. I don't know how to use it, I learn " that, that could happen because we discovered uh, uh, discovering continual learning. That could also happen because we trained the model on a bunch of environments and then generalized or it could happen because the model learns that in the context length. It, it, it doesn't actually matter which way. If we go back to the discussion we had like, like, an hour ago, that type of thing can happen and that type of thing can happen in several different ways. Yeah. Um, uh, uh, but, but I do think when for, for whatever reason the models have those skills then, uh, robotics will be revolutionized, both the design of robots because the models will be much better than humans at that um, and also the, the ability to kind of control robots. So we'll get better at the physic- building the physical hardware building the physical robots, and we'll also get better at controlling it. Now, you know, does that mean the robotics uh-. .. industry will also be generating trillions of dollars of revenue? My answer there is yes, but there will be the same extremely fast but not infinitely fast diffusion. So, will, will robotics be, be revolutionized? Yeah. Maybe tack on another year or two. Hmm. That's, that's my, that's the way I think about these things. Makes sense. Uh, there's a general, uh, skepticism about extremely fast progress. Like, here, here's my view, which is like, it sounds like you are gonna solve continual learning one way or another within a matter of years. But just as people weren't talking about continual learning a couple years ago and then we realized "Oh, why are these models as useful as they could be right now even though they are clearly passing the Turing test and are experts in so many different domains? Maybe it's this thing. " And then we solved this thing and we realized actually, there's another, um, another thing that human intelligence can do and that's a basis of human labor that these models can't do. And then, so, why do I think there will be more things like this? Why think that, like, we're, we're you know, we've like found the pieces of human intelligence? Well, well, to be clear, I mean I think continual learning, uh, as I said before might not be a barrier at all. Yeah. Right? Like, like, you know, I think I think we maybe just get there by pre-training generalization and and, and, and, and, and, and RL generalization. Like, I, I think there just might not be um. .. There, there basically might not be such a thing at all. In fact, I would point to the history in in ML of people coming up with things that are barriers that end up kind of dissolving within the big blob of compute right? That, you know, people talked about, you know you know, how do you have, you know how do, how do your models keep track of nouns and verbs and you know, how do they, you know. .. They can understand semant- syntactically, but they can't understand semantically you know. It, it's only statistical correlations. You can understand a paragraph. You can't understand a word. There's reasoning, you can't do reasoning, but then suddenly it turns out you can do code and math- Right. . .. very well at all. So I, I think there ac- there's there's actually a stronger history of some of these things seeming like a big deal- Mm-hmm. . .. and then, and then kind of, and then kind of dissolving. Some of 'em are real. I mean, the need for data is real. May- maybe continual, continual learn- continual learning is a real thing. But again, I would ground us in something like code. Like, I think we may get to the point in like a year or two where the models can just do SWE end-to-end. Like, that's a whole task. That's a whole sphere of human activity that that we're just saying models can do it now. Um- W- when you say end-to-end, do you mean um, setting technical direction, understanding the context of the problem and- Yes. . .. et cetera? Yes. Okay. Yes. So, I mean, all of that. Interesting. I mean, it, that, that is if you're like AGI-complete, um, which maybe is internally consistent but, uh, um, it's not like say, 90% of code or 100% of code. It's like, no, no- No, no. I, I, I- . .. the, the other parts of the job as well. No, no, no. I gave this, I gave the spectrum. Yeah, yeah. 90% of code, 100% of code, 90% of end-to-end SWE 100% of end-to-end SWE. New tasks are created for SWEs. Eventually those get done as well. Yeah. But it's a long spectrum- Makes sense. . .. there. But we're traversing the spectrum very quickly. Yeah. Um, I do think it's funny that. .. I, I, I've seen a couple of podcasts you've done where um, the host will be like, "Ah but Barkash wrote an essay about the continual learning thing " and it always makes me crack up 'cause you're like. .. You know, you, you've been an AI researcher for like 10 years. (laughs) I'm sure there's like some, uh feeling of like, okay, so a podcaster wrote an essay. No, look, look- (laughs) And like every interview I get asked about it. (laughs) You know, the, the truth of the the truth of the matter is that we're all trying to figure this out together. Yeah. Right? There, there are some ways in which I'm able to see things that others aren't. These days, that probably has more to do with like, I can see a bunch of stuff within Anthropic- Yeah. . .. and I have to make a bunch of decisions than I have any great research insight that that, that others don't. Right? I, you know, I'm running a 2 500-person company. Like, it's, it's actually pretty hard for me to (laughs) have have concrete research insight, you know, mu- uh much harder than, you know, than it than it would have been, you know 10 years ago or, or, you know or even two or three years ago. Um, as we go towards a world of a full drop in remote worker replacement does a API pricing model still make the most sense? And if not, what is the correct way to price AGI or serve AGI? Yeah. I mean, I think there's gonna be a bunch of different business models here sort of all at once, that are gonna be that are gonna be experimented with. Um, I, I, I actually do think that the the API, um, model is, is more durable than many people think. Um, one way I think about it is if the technology is kind of advancing quickly if it's advancing exponentially, what that means is there's there's always kind of like a surface area of of kind of new use cases that have been developed in in the last, uh, in the last three months. And any kind of product surface you put in place is always at risk of sort of becoming irrelevant right? Mm-hmm. Any given product surface probably makes sense for our you know, range of capabilities of the model right? The, the chatbot is already running into limitations of you know, uh, making it smarter doesn't really help the average consumer that much. But I don't think that's a limitation of AI models. I don't think that's evidence that, you know the models are, are, the models are good enough and they're they're, you know, them getting better doesn't matter to the economy. It doesn't matter to that particular product. Um, and, and so I think the value of the API is the API uh, always offers an opportunity, you know very close to the bare metal to build on what the latest thing is. Um, and so th- you know, there's there's, uh, there's kind of always gonna be this you know, this, this kind of front of new startups and new ideas that weren't possible a few months ago and are possible because the model is advancing. And, and so I, I actually, I I, I kind of actually predict that we are. .. it's gonna exist alongside other models, but we're always gonna have the API business model because there's a- there's always gonna be a need for a thousand different people to try experimenting with a model a different way and a hundred of them become startups and 10 of them become big successful startups, and, you know, two or three really end up being the the way that people use the model of a of, of a given generation. So I, I basically think it's always gonna exist. At the same time, uh-I'm sure there's gonna be other models as well like not every token that's output by the model is worth the same amount. Think about, you know, how, how h- w- what is the value of the tokens that are like, you know, that the model outputs when someone you know, call, you know, someone y- you know, calls them up and says "My Mac isn't working," or something. You know, the model's like, "Restart it " right? Yeah. Um, and like, you know, someone hasn't heard that before but like you know, the model said that like 10 million times right? Um, you know, that, that, m- maybe that's worth like a dollar or a few cents or something. Um, whereas if, uh, the model you know, the model goes to, you know one of the, one of the pharmaceutical companies and it says "Oh, you know, this molecule you're developing you should take the aromatic ring from that end of the molecule and put it on that end of the molecule. Um, and, and, you know, if you do that wonderful things will happen. " Um, uh, like, like those tokens could be worth (laughs) you know tens of millions of dollars, right? Um, uh, so, so I think we're definitely gonna see business models that that recognize that. You know, at some point we're gonna see you know, pay for results or y- y- you know in some, in some form or we may see forms of compensation that are like labor um, uh, you know, that, that kind of work by the hour. Um, I, I, you know I don't know. I think, I think, I think, uh th- because it's a new industry, a lot of things are gonna be tried and I you know, I don't know what will turn out to be the right thing. Um, w- what I find, uh. .. I, I, I take your point that people will have to try things to figure out what is the best way to use this blob of intelligence but what I find striking is Claude Code. So I don't think in the history of startups there has been a single application that has been as hotly competed in as coding agents and um, and, and Claude Code is a category leader here. And that seems surprising to me. Like it doesn't seem intrinsically like Anthropic had to build this and I wonder if you have an accounting of why it had to be Anthropic or why how Anthropic ended up building an application in addition to the model underlying it. Yeah. So it actually happened in a pretty simple way which is we had our own, um you know, w- w- we had our coding models- Yeah. . .. which were good at coding and, and you know, around the beginning of 2025 I said, "I, I think the time has come where you can have non-trivial acceleration of your own research um, y- if you're an AI company by using these models. " And of course, you know, we you need an interface, you need a harness to use them and so I encouraged people internally, you know I didn't say, "This is one thing that you know, that you have to use. " I, I just said, "People should experiment with this. " And then, you know, this thing I, I, uh, you know, I think it might have been originally called Claude CLI and then it then the name eventually got changed to Claude Code internally um, was the thing that kind of everyone was using and it was seeing fast internal adoption. And I looked at it and I said "Probably we should launch this externally," right? Um, uh, you know, it's, it's seen such fast adoption within Anthropic like you know, like, you know, coding is a lot of what we do and and so, you know, we have a we have a audience of many hu- many hundreds of people that's in some ways at least representative of the external audience so it looks like we already have product market fit. Let's launch this thing. Um, and, and then we launched it and and I think, you know, just, just the fact that we ourselves are kind of developing the model and we ourselves know what we most need to use the model I think it's, it's kinda creating this feedback loop. I see. In the sense that you. .. let's say a developer at Anthropic is like "Ah, it, it'd be better if it was better at this X thing " and then you bake that into the next model that you build. That, that's, that's one version of it but, but then there's just the ordinary product iteration of like you know, we have a bunch of we have a bunch of coders within Anthropic. Like, we, um, you know, they they like use Claude Code every day and so we get fast feedback. That was more important in the early days. Now, of course, there are millions of people using it um, and so we get a bunch of external feedback as well but it's, you, you know, it's just great to be able to get you know, kind of, kind of, uh um, fast, fast internal feedback. You know, I think this is the reason why we launched a coding model and you know, didn't launch a pharmaceutical company right? It, you know. .. uh, you know, my background's in- (laughs) . .. in, my background's in, in like biology but like we don't have any of the resources that are needed to launch a pharmaceutical company. (instrumental music) So, there's been a ton of hype around Open Claw and I wanted to check it out for myself. I've got a day coming up this weekend and I don't have anything planned yet so I gave Open Claw a Mercury debit card I set a couple hundred dollar limit and I said "Surprise me. " Okay, so here's the Mac Mini it's on and besides having access to my Mercury it's totally quarantined. Nashy felt quite comfortable giving it access to a debit card because Mercury makes it super easy to set up guard rails. I was able to customize permissions, cap the spend and restrict the category of purchases. I wanted to make sure the debit card worked so I asked Open Claw to just make a test transaction and decided to donate a couple of bucks to Wikipedia. Besides that, I have no idea what's gonna happen. I will report back on the next episode about how it goes. In the meantime, if you want a personal banking solution that can accommodate all the different ways that people use their money even experimental ones like this one, visit mercury. com/personal. Mercury is a fintech company, not an FDIC insured bank. Banking services provided through Choice Financial Group and Column N. A. Members FDIC. You know she thinks we're getting coffee and walking around the neighborhood. (laughs) Um, let me ask you about uh, now, um, making AI go well. Um, it seems like whatever vision we have about how AI goes well has to be compatible with two things. One is the ability to build and run AIs is diffusing extremely rapidly and two is that the population of AIs the amount we have and their intelligence, will also increase very rapidly. And that means that lots of people will be able to build huge populations of misaligned AIs or uh, AIs which are just like companies which are trying to increase their uh, footprint or have weird psyches like Sydney Bing but now they're superhuman. What is a vision for a world in which-. .. we have an equilibrium that is compatible with lots of different AIs some of which are misaligned, running around. Yeah, yeah. So I think, you know, in the adolescence of technology I was kind of, you know, skeptical of like, the balance of power. But I, I think I was particularly skeptical of or sp- The thing I was specifically skeptical of is you have like, three or four of these companies like, kind of all building models that are kind of deri- you know sort of, sort of, um, uh uh, like, derived from the, like derived from the same thing, and, uh you know, that, that these would check each other. Or, or even that kinda, you know any number of them would, would, would uh, would, would check each other. Like, we might live in a offense-dominant world where you know, like, one person or one AI model is like, smart enough to do something that like, causes damage for everything else. Um, I think in the l- I mean in the short run, we have a limited number of players now so we can start by, within the limited number of players we, uh, you know, w- we kind of you know, we, we need to put in place the you know, the safeguards. We need to make sure everyone does the right alignment work. We need to make sure everyone has bio classifiers. Like, you know, those are, those are kind of the immediate things we need to do. I agree that, you know, that that doesn't solve the problem in the long run particularly if the ability of AI models to make other AI models proliferates. Then, you know, uh, uh, uh i- i- the, the whole thing can kind of um, you know, i- i- can become harder to solve. I, you know, I thi- I think in the long run we need some architecture of governance, right? Some a- some architecture of governance that preserves human freedom but but kind of also allows us to, like you know, govern the, the very large number of kind of, um, you know, uh uh, uh, human systems, AI systems (laughs) hybrid, hybrid human, human, um you know, h- h- hybrid hu- h- hy- hybrid human AI like, you know, companies or, or like, or, like, or, like economic units. So, you know, we're g- we're gonna need to think about like, you know, how do we, how do we protect the world against you know, bioterrorism? How do we protect the world against, like you know, against, like, against, like mirror life? Like, you know, we're probab- probably we're gonna need to y- you know, need some kind of like, AI monitoring system that, like, moni- you know kinda monitors for, for all of these things. But then we need to build this in a way that like, you know, preserves civil liberties and like, our constitutional rights. So I think just, just as is a- a- as is anything else like, it's, it's like a new security landscape with a new set of you know, a new set of tools and a new set of vulnerabilities. And I, I think my worry is if we had a hundred years for this to happen all very slowly we'd get used to it, you know. Like we've gotten used to, like, you know the presence of, you know, the presence of explosives in society or like, the, you know, the presence of various um, you know, like, new weapons or the you know, the pre- the pre- the presence of video cameras. Um, we would get used to it over over, over, over a hundred y-. .. And we'd develop governance mechanisms. We'd make our mistakes. My, my worry is just that this is happening a- all so fast. Mm-hmm. And so I think maybe we need to do our thinking faster about how to make these governance mechanisms work. Yeah. It seems like in a offense-dominant world, over the course of the next century so the idea is that AI is making the progress that would happen over the next century happen in some period of five to 10 years. But w- we would still need the same mechanisms or balance of power would be similarly intractable even if humans were the only game in town. Um, and so I guess we have the advice of AI. We. .. It, it, it fundamentally doesn't seem like a totally different ballgame here. If checks and balances were gonna work, they would work with humans as well. If they aren't gonna work, they wouldn't work with AIs as well. Um, and so maybe this just dooms human checks and balances as well but- I, yeah, a- again, again I think there's some way to, I think there's some way to make this happen. Like, it, you know, it, it it just, it just, you know, the governments of the world may have to work together to make it happen. Like, you know, w- we may have to you may have to talk to AIs about kind of you know, building societal structures in such a way that like, these, these defenses are possible. Yeah. I, I, I don't know. I mean, this is so, this is you know, I, I don't wanna say so far ahead in time but, like, so far ahead in t- technological ability that may happen over a short period of time that it's hard for us to anticipate it in advance. Um, speaking of governments getting involved, on December 26th the Tennessee legislature introduced a bill which, uh said, quote, um, "It would be an offense for a person to knowingly train artificial intelligence to provide emotional support including through open-ended conversations with the user. " And of course, one of the things that Claude attempts to do is be a a thoughtful, um, a thoughtful friend, thoughtful knowledgeable friend, and in general, it seems like we're gonna have this patchwork of state laws. A lot of the benefits that normal people could experience as a result of AI are going to be curtailed especially when we get into the kinds of things you discuss in Machines of Love and Grace biological freedom, mental health improvements, et cetera et cetera. It seems easy to imagine worlds in which these get whacked all the way by different laws. Um, whereas bills like this don't seem to address the actual existential threats that you're concerned about. So I'm curious about, to understand in the context of things like this your anthropics position against the federal moratorium on state AI laws. Yes, yes. So I don't know. There's, there's many different things going on a- at once right? I think, I think that, that, I think that particular law is is dumb. Like, you know, I think it was it was clearly made by legislators who just probably had little idea what AI models could do and not do. They're like, "AI models serving us, th- that just sounds scary. Like, I don't want, I don't want that to happen. " So, you know, we're, we're, we're not we're not in favor of that, right? But, but, but th- you know, that that wasn't the thing that was being voted on. The thing with, that was being voted on is we're going to ban all state regulation of AI for 10 years with no apparent plan to to do any federal regulation of AI, which would take Congress to pass which is a very high bar. Um, so, you know, the idea that we ban states from doing anything for 10 years-And people said they had a plan for federal government but, you know, there was no actual there was no proposal on the table, there was no actual attempt. Um, given the serious dangers that I lay out in Adolescence of Technology around things like the you know, kind of biological weapons and bioterrorism autonomy risk, and the timelines we've been talking about like 10 years is an eternity. Like, that's, that's a, that's a I, I think that's a crazy thing to do. So if, if that's the choice, if that's what you force us to choose then, then we're gonna, we're gonna choose not to have that moratorium. And, you know, uh, the, I think the the, the benefits of that position exceed the costs but it's, it's not a perfect position if that's the choice. Now, I think the thing that we should do the thing that I would support, is the federal government should step in not saying, "States, you can't regulate," but "Here's what we're gonna do, and, and states you can't differ from this. " Right? Like, I think preemption is fine in the sense of saying that federal government says, "Here's our standard. This applies to everyone. States can't do something different. " That would be something I would support if it would be done in the right way. What, um, but, but this idea of states you can't do anything and we're not doing anything either that, that struck, that struck us as you know, very much not making sense and I think will not age well. It's already starting to not age well with with all the, um, backlash that, that you've seen. Now, in terms of, in terms of what we would want I mean, you know, the things we've talked about are are starting with transparency standards, um, uh uh, you know, in order to monitor some of these autonomy risks and bioterrorism risks. As the risks become more serious, um as we, as we get more evidence for them then I think we could be more aggressive in some targeted ways and and say, "Hey, AI bioterrorism is really a threat. Let's, let's pass a law that kinda forces people to have classifiers. " And I could even imagine, it, it depends it depends how serious a threat it ends up being. We don't know for sure. Then, we need to pursue this in an intellectually honest way or we say ahead of time, "The risk has not emerged yet. " But I could certainly imagine with the pace that things are going that you know, I could imagine a world where later this year we say "Hey, this, this AI bioterrorism stuff is really serious. We should do something about it. We should put it in a federal, we should you know, put it in a federal standard and if the federal government won't act, we should put it in the sta- state standard. " I could totally see that I, I I'm concerned about a world where if you just consider the l- the pace of progress you're expecting the life cycle of, of legislation, you know the, the benefits are, as you say because of diffusion lag, the benefits are slow enough that I really do think this patchwork of on the current trajectory, this patchwork of state laws would prohibit. .. I mean, having an emotional chatbot friend is something that freaks people out. Then just imagine the kinds of actual benefits from AI we want uh, normal people to be able to experience from improvements in health and health span and improvements in mental health and so forth. Whereas at the same time, uh, it seems like you think the dangers are already on the horizon and I just don't see that much, um. .. It, it, it seems like it would be especially injurious to the benefits of AI uh, as compared to the, the dangers of AI. And so that, that, that's maybe the where the cost-benefit makes less sense to me. So, so, so there's a few things here right? I mean, people talk about there being thousands of these state laws. First of all, the vast mass majority of them do not pass. Um, and, you know, the, the the, the, the, you know, the world works a certain way in theory but, like, just because a law has been passed doesn't mean it's really enforced right? The people, the people, you know, implementing it may be like "Oh my god. This is stupid. It would mean shutting off, like, you know everything that's ever been built and everything that's ever been built in Tennessee. " So, you know, very often laws are interpreted in like, you know, a way that makes them that, that, that makes them not as dangerous or not as harmful. On, on the same side, of course you have to worry if you're passing a law to stop a bad thing you had this, you had this problem as well. Yeah. Um, uh, look, my, my. .. Look, I mean, my basic view is you know, if, if, if, you know we could decide, you know, what laws were passed and how things were done which, you know, we're only one small input input into that, you know, I would deregulate a lot of the stuff around the health benefits of AI. Um, I think, uh, you know I, I, I don't worry as much about the like, the, the, the, the kind of chatbot laws. I, I actually worry more about the drug approval process where I think AI models are going to greatly accelerate um, the rate at which we discover drugs and just the, the pipeline will get jammed up. Like, the pipeline will not be prepared to like, process all, all of the stuff that's going through it. So, um, you know, I, I I think, I think reform of the regulatory process to bias more towards. .. We have a lot of things coming where the safety and the efficacy is actually gonna be really crisp and clear. Like, I mean, a b- beautiful thing r- really, really crisp and clear a- and like, really, really effective. But, you know, and, and, and maybe we don't need all this all this, um, uh, uh, like um, a- all this superstructure around it that was designed around an era of drugs that barely work and often have serious side effects. Um, but at the same time, I think we should be ramping up quite significantly, the, um, uh, you know this, this kind of safety and security legislation. And, you know, like I've said, um you know, starting with transparency is, is my view of trying not to hamper the industry right? Trying to find the right balance. I'm worried about it. Some people criticize my essay for saying, "That's too slow. The dangers of AI will come too soon if we do that. " Well, basically I kind of think, like the last six months and maybe the next few months are gonna be about transparency and then if these ri- if these risks emerge when we're more certain of them which I think we might be as soon as la- as later this year then I think we need to act very fast in the areas that we've actually seen the risk. Like, I think the only way to do this is to be nimble. Now, the legislative process is normally not nim- nimble but we, we need to emphasize. .. .. . to everyone involved, the urgency of this. That's why I'm sending this message of urgency right? That's why I wrote Adolescence of Technology. I wanted policymakers to read it, I wanted economists to read it I want national security professionals to read it. You know, I want decision-makers to read it so that they have some hope of acting faster than they would have otherwise. Is there anything you can do or advocate that would make it s- more certain that the benefits of AI are um, are better instantiated? Where I feel like you have worked with legislatures to be like "Okay, we're gonna prevent bio-terrorism here, or wait we're gonna increase insurance here, we're gonna increase whistleblower protection. " And I just think by default, the actual ben- like the things we're looking forward to here, it just seems very easy they seem very fragile to, uh, different kinds of moral panics or political economy problems. Yeah, I don't actually . .. So, so I don't actually agree that much in the developed world. I feel like, you know, in the developed world like, markets function pretty well, and when there's when there's, like, a lot of money to be made on something and it's clearly the best available alternative- Hm. . .. it's actually hard for the regulatory system to stop it. You know, we're s- we're seeing that in AI itself right? I, uh, you know, like, a thing I've been trying to fight for is export controls on chips to China right? And, like, that's in the national security interests of the US like, you know, that's, like, square within the you know, the, the policy beliefs of you know, every, almost everyone in Congress of both parties. But a- and, you know, I think the case is very clear the counterarguments against it are, I'll politely call them fishy um, uh, and yet it doesn't happen and we sell the chips because there's- there's so much money there's so much money riding on it. Um, and, you know, the, the that money wants to be made and, and in that case in my opinion, that's a bad thing. Um, and, but, but it also it also applies when- when it's a good thing. And- and so I- I don't think that if we're talking about drugs and benefits of the technology I- I- I am not as worried about those benefits being hampered in the developed world. I am a little worried about them going a li- too slow and I, as I said, I do think we should work to speed the approval process in the FDA. I do think we should fight against these chatbot bills that you're describing right, described individually. I'm against them. I think they're stupid. Um, but I actually think the bigger worry is the developing world um, where we don't have functioning markets where, um, you know, we often can't build on the technology that- that we've had. I worry more that those folks will get left behind. And I worry that even if the cures are developed you know, maybe there's someone i- in rural Mississippi who- who doesn't get it as well right? That's a, that's a, that's a kinda smaller version of the thing the concern we have in the, in the developing world. And so the things we've been doing are you know, w- you know, we work with you know, w- we work with, you know philanthropists, right? You know, we work with folks, um who, you know, who, mm, you know deliver, you know, medicine and health interventions to you know, to- to developing world, to Subsaharan Africa you know, India, Latin America, you know uh, uh, uh, you know, other- other developing parts of the world. That's the thing I think that won't happen on its own Hm. You mentioned expert controls. Yeah. Why can't US and China both have a country of geniuses- Why can't? . .. on a data center? Why can't, you know, why won't it happen or why shouldn't it happen? No, like, why- why shouldn't it happen? Why shouldn't it happen? Um, you know, I think, I think if this does happen um, you know, then- then we kind of have a . .. Well, w- we could have a few situ- if we have like, an offense-dominant situation, we could have a situation like nuclear weapons but, like, more dangerous, right? Where it's, like, um, you know kind of, kind of either side could- could easily destroy everything. Um, we could also have a world where it's kind of it's unstable. Like, the nuclear equilibrium is stable, right because it's, you know, it's like deterrence. But let's say there were uncertainty about, like if the two AIs fought, which AI would win. Um, that could create instability, right? The, well, you often have conflict when the two sides have a different assessment of their likelihood of winning right? If one side is like, "Oh, yeah there's a 90% chance I'll win," and the other side's like "There's a 90% chance I'll win," then- then- then a fight is much more likely. Um, they can't both be right, but they can both think that. But this is, like, a g- fully general argument against the diffusion of AI technology. Which it may, it, which is, that's the implication of this world. Um- Well, so l- well, let me l- l- well, let me just go on 'cause I think we will get diffusion eventually. The other concern I have is that people the governments will oppress their own people with AI. And- and- and so, um, you know I'm- I'm just w- I'm worried about some world where you have a country that's already a you know, kind of a, uh, you know uh, uh, you know, there's- there's a government that kind of kind of already, um, you know, is- is kind of kind of building a, you know, a tech a high-tech authoritarian state. Um, and to be clear, this is about the government this is not about the people. Like, people, we need to find a way for people everywhere to benefit. Um, my worry here is about governments. Um, so yeah, my, you know my- my worry is if the world gets carved up into two pieces one of those two pieces could be authoritarian or totalitarian in a way that's very difficult to displace. Um, now, will- will governments eventually get powerful AI and- and you know, there's risk of authoritarianism? Yes. Will governments eventually get powerful AI and there's risk of um, uh, you know, of- of kind of bad bad, bad equilibria? Yes, I think both things. But the initial conditions matter, right? You know, w- a- a- at some point we're need, we're gonna need to set up the rules of the road. I'm not saying that one country, either the United States or a coalition of democracies which I think is a, would be a better setup although it requires more international cooperation than we currently seem to wanna make. Um, but, you know, I don't I don't think a coalition of democracies or- or certainly one country should just say "These are the rules of the road. " There's gonna be some negotiation, right? The world is gonna have to-. .. grapple with this. And what I would like is that the the, the, you know, the democratic nations of the world those with, you know, w- who are clo- whose governments have represent closer to pro-human values ar- are holding the stronger hand then have, have more leverage when the rules of the road are set. And, and so I'm, I'm very concerned about that initial condition. W- I, um, I was re-listening to an interview from three years ago and one of the ways it aged poorly is that I kept asking questions assuming there was gonna be some key fulcrum moment at two to three years from now when in fact, being that far out, it just seems like progress continues AI improves, AI is more diffused and people use it for more things. It seems like you're imagining a world in the future where the countries get together and "Here's the rules of the road and here's the leverage we have here's the leverage you have," when it seems like on current trajectory, everybody will have more AI um, some of that AI will be used by authoritarian countries some of that within the authoritarian countries will be by it's by private actors versus state actors. It's not clear who b- will benefit more. It's always unpredictable to ten- uh, tell in advance you know, it seems like the internet privileged authoritarian countries more than you would've expected um, and maybe the AI will be the opposite way around. Um, so I, I, I want to better understand what you're imagining here. Yeah, yeah, so, so just to be precise about it I think the exponential of the underlying technology will continue as it has before right? The models get smarter and smarter even when they get to Country of Geniuses in a data center p- you know, I, I, I think you can continue to make the model smarter. There's a question of, like, getting diminishing returns on their value in the world right? How much does it matter after you've already solved human biology or you know, eh, ah, y- you know at some point, you can do harder math you can do more abstruse math problems, but nothing after that matters. But putting that aside, I do think the the exponential will continue, but there will be certain distinguished points on the exponential and companies individuals, countries will reach those points at different times. Um, and, and so, you know there's, there's, uh, you know, could there be some you know, I, you know, I talk about is a nuclear deterrent still in adolescents of technology, is a nuclear deterrent still stable uh, in the world of, of, of AI? I don't know, but that's, that's an example of like, one thing we've taken for granted that like, the technology could reach such a level that it's no longer like, you know, we can no longer be certain of it at least. Um, uh, you know, think of think of others. You know, there, there, th- uh you know, there, there are kind of points where if you r- if you reach a certain point you, maybe you have offensive cyber dominance and like, every, every computer system is transparent to you after that um, uh, un- unless the other side has a has a kind of equivalent defense. So I don't know what the critical moment is or if there s- a single critical moment but I think there will be either a critical moment a small number of critical moments, or some critical window where it's like AI is. .. AI confers some large advantage from the perspective of national security and one country or coalition has reached it before others. That, that, you know, that, that th- uh, you know, I'm not advocating that they're just like "Okay, we're in charge now. " Or th- th- that's not, that's not how that's not how I think about it. You know, the, there's always the, the other side is catching up there's extreme actions you're not willing to take and, and, and it's not right to take you know, to take complete, um, to take complete control anyway. But, but at, at the point that that happens I think people are gonna understand that the world has changed and there, there's gonna be some negotiation implicit or explicit, about what, what is the what is the post-AI world order look like? And, and I think my interest is in you know, making that neg- negotiation be one in which you know, classical liberal democracy has, you know has a strong hand. Well, uh, I wanna understand what that better means 'cause you say in the essay quote, "Autocracy is simply not a form of government that people can accept in the post-powerful AI age " and that sounds like you're saying the CCP as an institution cannot exist after we get AGI. Um, and that seems like a, uh like a s- very strong demand, and it seems to imply a world where the leading lab or the leading country will be able to and by that language should, get to determine how the world is governed or what kinds of governments are allowed and not allowed. Yeah, so w- when I, when I um, I, I believe, w- that that paragraph was I think I said something like, "You could take it even further and say X. " So I wasn't, I wasn't necessarily endorsing that that, tha- I wasn't necessarily endorsing that view. I, you know, I was saying, like "Here's the first, you know, here, here's a weaker thing that I believe. " You know, I think I, you know I think I said, you know, we have to worry a lot about authoritarians- Right. . .. and, you know, we should try and you know, kind of, kinda check them and limit their power. Like, you could take this kind of further much more interventionist view that says, like authoritarian countries with AI are these, you know the- the- the, you know, the- these kind of self-fulfilling cycles that that you can't, that are very hard to displace and so you just need to get rid of them fro- from the beginning. That, that has exactly all the problems you say which is, you know, uh, uh y- you know, if you were to make a commitment to overthrowing every authoritarian country I mean, they, then they would take a bunch of actions now that like- Right. . .. you know, that, that, that, could could lead to instability. So that, that may or m- you know that, th- that just, that just may not be possible. But the point I was making, that I do endorse is that it is, it is quite possible that you know, today, you know, the view or at least my view, or the view in most of the Western world is is democracy is a better form of government than authoritarianism. But it's not like if a country's authoritarian we don't react the way we reacted if they committed a genocide or something right? And, and I'm, uh, wh- I guess what I'm saying is I'm a little worried that in the age of AGI authoritarianism will have a different meaning, it will be a graver thing. Um, and, and we have to decide one way or another how to h- wh- h- how, how, how to deal with that and the interventionist view is one possible view. I was exploring such views. Um, you know, uh-. .. it may end up being the right view it- it may end up being too extreme to be the right view. But I do have hope. And- and one piece of hope I have is there- there is . .. we have seen that as new technologies are invented forms of government become obsolete. I- I mentioned this in Adolescence of Technology where I said you know, like feudalism was basically, you know like a form of government, right? And- and then when- when we invented industrialization feudalism was no longer sustainable, it no longer made sense. Why is that hope? Why- couldn't that imply that democracy is no longer gonna be- Well- . .. a competitive system? . .. it- it could . .. Right, it could go, it could go either way right? But- but I actually . .. So I- these problems with authoritarianism, right that the problems with authoritarianism get deeper, I just I wonder if that's an indicator of other problems that authoritarianism will have right? In other words, people become . .. Because authoritarianism becomes worse, people are more afraid of authoritarianism. They work harder to stop it. It's- it's more of a c- like you have to think in terms of total equilibrium right? Um, I just wonder if it will motivate new ways of thinking about with- with- with the new technology, how to preserve and protect freedom. Mm. And- and, uh, even more optimistically, will it lead to a collective reckoning and you know, a- a- a kind of a- a more emphatic realization of how important some of the things we take as individual rights are right? A- a more emphatic realization that we just we really can't give these away. There's- there- we've seen, there's no other way to live that actually works. Yeah. Um, I- I- I am actually I am actually hopeful that . .. I- I guess one way to say it it sounds too idealistic but I actually believe it could be the case is th- is that, is that dictatorships become morally obsolete they become morally unworkable forms of government. Um, and that, and that, and that the- the- the- the crisis that that creates is- is- is sufficient to force us to find another way. Um, th- I think there is genuinely a tough question here which I'm not sure how you resolve for, uh, and we've had to come out one way or another on it through history right? So with China in the '70s and '80s we decided even though it's an authoritarian system we will engage with it, and I think in retrospect that was the right call because it had stayed an authoritarian system but a billion plus people are much wealthier and better off than they would have otherwise been. Um, and it's not clear that it would have stopped being an authoritarian country otherwise. You can just look at North Korea, uh as an example of that, right? And I don't know if that takes that much int- that much intelligence to remain an authoritarian country that continues to coalesce its own power and so you can just imagine a North Korea with an AI that's much worse than everybody else's but still enough to keep power. (laughs) And- a- a- and- and- and- and so in general it seems like should we just have this attitude of the benefits of AI will in the form of all these empowerments of humanity and health and so forth will be big and- and historically we have decided it's good to spread the benefits of technology widely even with, even to people whose governments are authoritarian. And I think, I guess it is a tough question about how to think about it with AI but, um, historically, we have said yes this- this is a positive sum world, and it's still worth diffusing the technology. Yeah, so- so there are a number of choices we have. I, you know, I think framing this as a kind of government to government decision and uh, you know, in- in national security terms that's like one lens, but there are a lot of other lenses. Like, you could imagine a world where you know, we produce all these cures to diseases and like the, you know, the- the- the cures to diseases are fine to sell to authoritarian countries. The data centers just aren't, right? The chips and the data centers just aren't um, and- and that the AI industry itself um . .. Uh, you know, like- like another possibility is and- and I think folks should think about this like, you know, could there be developments we can make either that naturally happen as a result of AI or that we could make happen by building technology on AI? Could we create an equilibrium where- where it becomes infeasible for authoritarian countries to deny their people kind of private use of the benefits of the technology? Um, uh, you know, are there- are there- are there- are there equilibria where we can kind of give everyone an authoritarian country their own AI model that kind of you- you know, like defends themselves from surveillance and there isn't a way for the authoritarian country to like crack- crack down on this while- while retaining power? I don't know. That- that sounds to me like if that went far enough it would be, it would be a reason why authoritarian countries would disintegrate from the inside. Um, but- but maybe there's a middle world where like there- there's an equilibrium where if they want to hold on to power the authoritarians can't deny kind of individualized access access to the technology. But I actually do have a hope for the- for the um, for the- for the more radical version which is you know, is- is it possible that the technology might inherently have properties or that by building on it in certain ways we could create properties, um, that- that- that- that have this kind of dissolving effect on authoritarian structures? Now, we- we hoped originally, right, if we think back to the beginning of the Obama administration we thought originally that- that, you know social media and- and the internet would have that property and turns out not to. But- but I- I don't know. What- what if we could, uh, what if we could try again with- with the knowledge of how many things could go wrong and that this is a different technology? I don't know that it would work, but it's worth a try Yeah. I- I- I think it's just (instrumental music) . .. it's very unpredictable. Like, there- there's first principles reasons why authoritarianism might be privileged but- It's- it's all, it's all very unpredictable. Yeah. I- I don't think . .. I- I mean we got it, we- we just gotta we kind of . .. We gotta recognize the problem and then we gotta come up with 10 things we can try and we gotta try those and then assess whether they're working or wh- which ones are working if any, and- and then try new ones if the old ones aren't working. But I guess what, and that's up to today is you say-We will not sell data centers or sorry, uh, chips, and then the ability to make chips to China. And so in some sense, you are denying there would be some benefits to- That's right. . .. the Chinese economy, Chinese people, et cetera because we're doing that. And then there would also be benefits to the American economy because it's a positive sum world. We could trade. They could have their country's ch- data centers doing one thing. We could have ours doing another. And already, we, uh, you're saying it's not worth that positive sum uh, stipend to empower those countries. Is that- Well, what, what I would say is that you know, we are, we are about to be in a world where growth and economic value will come very easily if right, if we're able to build these powerful- Yeah. . .. AI models. Growth and economic value will come very easily. What will not come easily is distribution of benefits distribution of wealth, political freedom. Um, you know, these are the things that are gonna be hard to achieve. And so when I think about policy, I think I think that the technology and the market will deliver all the fundamental benefits you know, almost, almost faster than we can take them. Um, uh, and, and that these questions about about distribution and political freedom and rights are are, are the ones that, that will actually matter and that policy should focus on. Hmm. Okay, so speaking of distribution, as you were mentioning we have developing countries and, um, in many cases catch-up growth has weak- been weaker than we would have hoped for. Yes. But when catch-up growth does happen, it's fundamentally because they have under-utilized labor. Yes. And we can bring the capital and know-how from developed- Yes. . .. countries to these countries, and then they can grow quite rapidly. Yes. Obviously, in a world where labor is no longer the constraining factor this mechanism no longer works. And so is the hope basically to rely on philanthropy from the people who immediately get wealthy from AI or from the countries that get wealthy from AI? What i- what is the hope for- I mean I'm, I mean, philanthropy should obviously play some role as it has th- th- pe- Yeah. . .. you know, as it ha- has in the past. But I think growth is always, growth is always better and stronger if we can make it endogenous. Yeah. So, you know, what are the relevant industries in like in li- in like, in like an AI dri- driven world? Look, there's lots of stuff, you know like there's a. .. You know, I said, I said we shouldn't build data centers in China but there's no reason we shouldn't build data centers in Africa right? Um, in fact, I think it'd be great to build data centers in Africa. Um, you know, as long as they're not owned by China we sh- we should build, we should build data centers in Africa. I think that's a, that's a, that's a. .. I think that's a great thing to do. Um, you know, we should also build you know, there's no reason we can't build you know, a pharmaceutical industry that's like AI-driven. Like, you know, the, the i- if AI's accelerating accelerating drug discovery, then, you know, there will be a bunch of biotech startups. Like, let's make sure some of those happen in the developing world. And certainly during the transition, I mean we can talk about the point where humans have no role but, but humans will have, still have some role in starting up these companies and supervising supervising the AI models. So let's make sure some of those humans are humans in the developing world so that fast growth can happen there as well. Hmm. You guys recently announced Claude is gonna have a constitution that's aligned to a set of values and not necessarily just to the end user. And there's a world you can imagine where if it is aligned to the end user it preserves the balance of power we have in the world today because everybody gets to have their own AI that's advocating for them and so the ratio of bad actors to good actors stays constant. It seems to work out for our world today. Um, why is it better not to do that but to have a specific set of values that the AI should carry forward? Uh, yeah, so I, I'm not sure I'd quite draw the distinction in that way. Yeah. Um, there, there are maybe two relevant distinctions here which are, uh, I think you're talking about a mix of the two. Like, one is should we give the model a set of instructions about do this and do- versus don't do this? Yeah. And the other, uh, you know, versus should we give the model a set of principles for you know, for kind of how to act? Um, and, and, and there, it's it's, you know, it's, it, it it, you know, it's just pu- it's it's kind of purely a practical and empirical thing that we've observed that by teaching the model principles getting it to learn from principles, its behavior is more consistent it's easier to cover edge cases, and the model is more likely to do what people want it to do. In other words, if y- you know if you're like, you know, "Don't tell people how to hotwire a car. Don't speak in Korean. Don't. .. " you know, d- d- uh, you know just, you know, if you give it a list of rules it doesn't really understand the rules, and it's kind of hard to generalize from them um, you know, if, if it's just kind of a like you know, list of do, dos and don'ts. Whereas if you give it principles and then it you know, it has some hard guardrails like don't make biological weapons, but overall you're trying to understand what it should be aiming to do h- how it should be aiming to operate. So just from a practical perspective, that turns out to be just a more effective way to train the model. That's one piece of it. So that, you know, that's the kind of rules versus principles trade-off. Then there's another thing you're talking about, which is kind of like the corrigibility versus um, like, you know, I would say kind of intrin- y- uh intrinsic motivation trade-off, which is like how much should the model be a kind of I don't know, like a, a, a skin suit or something where you know, y- y- you know, y- y- you know you just kind of, you know, it it just kind of fo- directly follows the instructions that are given to it by whoever is giving it those instructions um, versus how much should the model have an inherent set of values and and go off and do things on its own? Um, and, and, and, and, and there I, I would actually say e- everything about the model is actually closer to the direction of of like, you know, it should mostly do what people want. It should mostly follow the ins- We're not trying to build something that like you know, goes off and runs the world on its own. We're actually pretty far on the corrigible side. Now, now what we do say is there are certain things that the model won't do right? That it's like, you know, that, that that un- and I think we say it in various ways in the constitution that under normal circumstances, if someone asks the model to do a task it should do that task. That, that should be the default. Um, but if you've asked it to do something dangerous or if you've you know, if you've, um, asked it to um. .. .. . you know, uh, uh, uh, to kind of harm someone else um, then the model is unwilling to do that. So, I, I actually think of it as like, a mostly, a mostly corrigible model that has some limits but those limits are based on principles. Yeah. I, I mean, then the fundamental question is how are those principles determined? And this is not a special question for Anthropic. Yeah. This would be a question for any AI company. But, um, uh, because you have been the ones to actually write down the principles I get to ask you this question. Uh, normally, a constitution is, like you write it down, it's set in stone and there's a process of updating it and changing it and so forth. In this case, it seems like a document that people at Anthropic write that can be changed at any time, that guides the behavior of systems that are gonna be the basis of a lot of economic activity. What is the. .. H- h- how do you think about h- how how those principles should be set? Yes. Um, so I think there's, there's two there's maybe three, three kind of sizes of loop here right? Yeah, yeah. Three, three ways to iterate. One is you can iterate, we iterate within Anthropic. We train the model, we're not happy with it and we kinda change the constitution. Yeah. And I think that's good to do. Um, and, you know, putting out publicly you know, making updates to the constitution every once in a while saying, "Here's a new constitution. " Right. I think that's good to do 'cause people can comment on it. The second level of loop is different companies will have different constitutions. Um, and, you know, I think it's useful for like, Anthropic puts out a constitution and you know, G- Gemini model puts out a constitution and you know, other companies put out a constitution and then, then they can kind of look at them compare. Outside observers can ch- critique and say, "This this, I like this one, this thing from this constitution and this thing from that constitution " and, and then kind of that, that creates some kind of you know, soft incentive and feedback for all the companies to like, take the best of each elements and improve. Then, I think there's a third loop which is, you know, society beyond the AI companies and beyond just those who kind of you know, who, who comment on the constitutions without hard power. And, and there, you know, we've done some experiments. Like, you know, a couple years ago we did an experiment with, I think it was called the Collective Intelligence Project to like, um, you know, to, to basically poll people and ask them what should be in our AI constitution. Um, uh, and, and, you know I think at the time, we incorporated some of those changes. And so you could imagine with the new approach we've taken to the constitution doing something like that, it's a little harder because it's like that was actually an easier approach to take when the constitution was like, a list of dos and don'ts. Um, at the level of principles, it has to have a certain amount of coherence. Um, but, but you could, you could s- still imagine getting views from a wide variety of people and I think you could also imagine, and this is like, a crazy idea, but hey, you know this whole interview is about cra- crazy ideas right? (laughs) So, um, uh, you know you could even imagine systems of, of kind of representative government having having input, right? Like, you know, I, I wouldn't I wouldn't do this today because the legislative process is so slow. Like, this is exactly why I think we should be careful about the legislative process in AI regulation. But there's no reason you couldn't, in principle say, like, you know, "All AI uh, you know, all AI models have to have a constitution that starts with like, these things, and then, like you can append, you can append other things after it but, like, there has to be this special section that like, takes precedence. " I wouldn't do that. That's too rigid. That, that sounds, um, you know that, that, that, that sounds kind of overly prescriptive in a way that I think overly aggressive legislation is. But, like, that is a thing you could uh, you know, like, like, that is a that is a thing you could try to do. Is, is there some much less heavy-handed version of that? Maybe. I, I, I really like control loop two um, where obviously this is not how constitutions of actual governments do or should work where ther- there's now this vague sense in which the Supreme Court will feel out well, how people are feeling and what are the vibes and then- Yeah. . .. update the, update the constitution accordingly. So, there's- Yeah. . .. uh, with actual governments, there's a more procedural pro- uh- More formal process yeah. . .. process, yeah, exactly. But w- you actually have a vision w- of competition between constitutions which is actually very reminiscent of how, um some libertarian charter studies people used to talk about- Yes. . .. what an archipelago of different kinds of governments would look like. Yes, yes. And then there would be selection among them of who could operate the most effectively whi- Yes. . .. in which place people would be the happiest and in, in a sense, you're actually y- yeah, there's this vision of- I I'm, I'm, I'm kind of recreating that. Um- Yeah, yeah, like the, this like, utopia of archipelagos, you know? . .. you know, uh, again, you know I think, I think that vision has has, you know, uh, things to recommend it and things that things that, things that will kind of kind of go wrong with it. You know, I think, I think it's a I think it's an interesting and in some ways compelling vision. Yeah. But also things will go wrong with it that you hadn't that you hadn't imagined. So, you know, I, I, I like loop two as well but I, I, I feel like the whole thing has gotta be some some mix of loops one, two, and three and it's a, it's a matter of the proportions right? Yeah. I, I think that's gotta be the the answer. Um. .. When somebody eventually writes the equivalent of the making of the atomic bomb for this era what is the thing that will be hardest to glean from the historical record th- they're most likely to miss? I think a few things. One is, at every moment of this exponential the extent to which the world outside it didn't understand it. This is, this is a bias that's often present in history where a- anything that actually happened looks inevitable in retrospect. And, and so, you know, I I think when people, when people look back it will be hard for them to put themselves in the place of people who were actually making a bet on this thing to happen that wasn't inevitable that we had these arguments, like the arguments I you know, that I make for scaling or that continual learning will be solved. Um, uh, uh, you know, that that s- you know, some of us internally in our heads put a high probability on this happening. But, but it's like, there's, there's a world outside us that's not that's not acting on, uh, that's not kind of not acting on that at all. Hm. Um, uh, and, and, and I think I think the, the weirdness of it um, I, I, I think unfortunately like, the insularity of it, like, you know a-. .. if, if we were one year or two years away from it h- happening like, the average person on the street has no idea. And that's one of the things I'm trying to change like, with the memos, with talking to policymakers. But, like, I don't know, I think I, I, I think that's just a that's just, like, a crazy, that's just like, a crazy thing. Yeah. Um, finally, I would say, and and this probably applies to almost all historical moments of crisis um, how absolutely fast it was happening how everything was happening all at once, and so decisions that you might think you know, were kinda carefully calculated, well actually, you have to make that decision and then you have to make 30 other decisions on the on the same day because it's all happening so fast. And, and you don't even know which decisions are gonna turn out to be consequential. So, you know, one of my, uh one of my, I guess, worries, although it's also an insight into- into uh, you know, in- into kind of what's happening is that you know, some very critical decision will be will be some decision that, you know someone just comes into my office and is like "Dario, you have two minutes. " Like, you know, "Should we, should we do you know, should we do thing, thing A or thing B on this like. .. " You know, someone gives me this random you know, half-page, half-page memo and is like "Should we, should we do A or B? " And I'm like, "I don't know, I have to eat lunch let's do B. " (laughs) And, and, you know, that ends up being the most consequential thing ever. Hmm. So final question, uh, it seems like you have. .. Th- there's not tech CEOs who are usually writing 50-page memos every few months and it seems like you have managed to build a role for yourself and a company around you which is compatible with this more intellectual type role of CEO and I wanna understand how you construct that and how like, how does that work? To be. .. Th- wha- you just go away for a couple of weeks and then you tell your company "This is the memo," like, "Here's what we're doing. " It's also reported that you write a bunch of these internally. Yeah, so, I mean, for this particular one I, you know, I wrote it over winter break. Yeah. Um, uh, so there, there was the ti- you know and I was having a, a hard time f- finding the time to actually find it to actually write it. But I actually think about this in a broader way. Um, I actually think it relates to the culture of the company so I probably spend a third, maybe 40% of my time making sure the culture of Anthropic is good. Hmm. As Anthropic has gotten larger, it's, it's gotten harder to just you know, get involved in, like, you know directly involved in, like, the training of the models the launch of the models, the building of the products. Like, it's 2,500 people, it's, like you know, there's just. .. You know, I have certain instincts but like, there's only, you know, that I I, I, it's very difficult to get in- to get to get involved in every single detail. You know, I, like, I, I try as much as possible. But one thing that's very leveraged is making sure Anthropic is a good place to work people like working there, everyone thinks of themselves as team members everyone works together instead of against each other and, you know, we've seen as some of the other AI companies have grown without naming any names, you know, we're starting to see decoherence and people fighting each other. And, you know, I would argue there was even a lotta that from the beginning but but, you know, that it's, it's gotten worse. But I, I think we've done an extraordinarily good job even if not perfect, of holding the company together making everyone feel the mission, that we're sincere about the mission and that, you know, everyone has faith that everyone else there is working for the right reason that we're a team, that people aren't trying to get ahead at each other's expense or backstab each other which, again, I think happens a lot at some of the other places. Um, and, and how do you make that the case? I mean, it's a lot of things you know, it's me, it's, it's it's Daniela who, you know, runs the company day-to-day it's the cofounders, it's the other people we hire it's the environment we try to create. But I think an important thing in the culture is I some, and the s- you know, sl- the other the, the, you know, the other leaders as well but especially me have to articulate what the company is about why it's doing what it's doing, what its strategy is what its values are, what its mission is and what it stands for. And, um, you know, when you get to 2 500 people, you can't do that person by person. You have to write or you have to speak to the whole company. This is why I get up in front of the whole company every two weeks and speak for an hour. It's actually, I mean, I wouldn't say I write essays internally. I do two things. One, I write this thing called a DVQ Dario Vision Quest. Um, uh, I wasn't the one who named it that that's the name it, it received and it's one of these names that I kind of I tried to fight it 'cause it made it sound like I was like, going off and smoking peyote or something (laughs) . .. um, uh, but, but the name just stuck. Um, so I get up in front of the company. Every two weeks, I have, like, a three or four-page document and I just kind of talk through like, three or four different topics about what's going on internally the, you know, the, the models we're producing the products, the outside industry, the world as a whole as it relates to AI and geopolitically in general. You know, just some mix of that. And I just go through very, very honestly I just go through and I just, I just say you know, "This is, this is what I'm thinking this is what Anthropic leadership is thinking," and then I answer questions. And, and that direct connection, I think has a lot of value that is hard to achieve when you're passing things down the chain you know, six, six levels deep. Um, uh, and, you know, uh uh, large fraction of the company comes comes to attend, either, either in person or um, either in person or virtually, and it you know, it really means that you can communicate a lot. And then the other thing I do is I just you know, I have a channel in Slack where I just write a bunch of things and comment a lot. Um, and often that's in response to you know, just things I'm seeing at the company or questions people ask or, like, you know, we do internal surveys and there are things people are concerned about and so I'll write them up. And I'm like, I'm, you know, I'm I'm, I'm just, I'm very honest about these things you know? I just, I just say them very directly and the point is to get a reputation of telling the company the truth about what's happening to call things what they are, to acknowledge problems to avoid the sort of corpo-speak, the kind of defensive communication that often is necessary in public because you know, the world is very large and full of people who are you know, interpreting things in bad faith. Um, but, you know, if you have a company of people who you trust and we try to hire people that we trust then, then, you know, you can you can, you can, you know, you can you can really just be entirely unfiltered Hmm. Um, and, uh, you know, I think I think that's an enormous strength of the company it makes it a better place to work it makes people more, m- you know more the sum of their parts, and increases the likelihood that we accomplish the mission 'cause everyone is on the same page about the mission and everyone is debating and discussing how best to accomplish the mission. Hmm. Well, in lieu of an external Dario Vision Quest we have this interview. (laughs) Th- this, this interview's a little like that. (laughs) Uh, this has been fun, Dario. Thanks for doing it. Yeah.
